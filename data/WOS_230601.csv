However, knowledge of the effects of habitat change on the gut microbiota of wild birds is limited. In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota of two different subspecies of the Silver-eared Mesia (Leiothrix argentauris), the native subspecies (L. a. rubrogularis) and immigrant subspecies (L. a. vernayi), using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. These two subspecies live in a trace metal-contaminated area, and L. a. vernayi was trafficked. They are an excellent system for studying how the gut microbiome of wild animal changes when they move to new habitats. We hypothesized that the immigrant subspecies would develop the same adaptations as the native subspecies in response to habitat changes. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the composition, diversity, or functional metabolism of gut microbiota between native and immigrant subspecies under the combined action of similar influencing factors (the p values of all analyses of variance >0.05). In addition, the composition and functional metabolism of gut microbiota in two subspecies showed adaptation against trace metal damage. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis revealed that Massilia in the intestinal microbiota of immigrant subspecies was significantly higher than that of native subspecies, suggesting that immigrant subspecies suffered habitat change. Finally, we found that these two subspecies living in the mining area had an extremely high proportion of pathogenic bacteria in their gut microbiota (about 90%), much higher than in other species (about 50%) living in wild environment. Our results revealed the adaptation of intestinal microbiota of immigrant Silver-eared Mesias under heavy metals stress, which would provide guidance for biodiversity conservation and pollution management in mining area.","[Zhou, Tianlong; Liu, Shilong; Jiang, Aiwu] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning, Peoples R China",Guangxi University,"Jiang, AW (corresponding author), Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning, Peoples R China.",aiwuu@gxu.edu.cn,,", Tianlong/0000-0001-7900-0879",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870370]; Key Grant of Guangxi Nature and Science Foundation [2018GXNSFDA281016],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Grant of Guangxi Nature and Science Foundation,This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870370) and the Key Grant of Guangxi Nature and Science Foundation (2018GXNSFDA281016).,,91,0,0,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Salmonella-contaminated poultry products are one of the major sources of salmonellosis. Given the critical role of the gut microbiota in Salmonella transmission, a manipulation of the chicken intestinal microenvironment could prevent animal colonization by the pathogen. In Salmonella, the global regulator gene fnr (fumarate nitrate reduction) regulates anaerobic metabolism and is essential for adapting to the gut environment. This study tested the hypothesis that an attenuated Fnr mutant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (attST) or prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) could improve resistance to wild-type Salmonella via modifications to the structure of the chicken gut microbiome. Intestinal samples from a total of 273 animals were collected weekly for 9 weeks to evaluate the impact of attST or prebiotic supplementation on microbial species of the cecum, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. We next analyzed changes to the gut microbiome induced by challenging the animals with a wild-type Salmonella serovar 4,[ 5], 12: r: - (Nalr) strain and determined the clearance rate of the virulent strain in the treated and control groups. Both GOS and the attenuated Salmonella strain modified the gut microbiome but elicited alterations of different taxonomic groups. The attST produced significant increases of Alistipes and undefined Lactobacillus, while GOS increased Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillus reuteri. The microbiome structural changes induced by both treatments resulted in a faster clearance after a Salmonella challenge. IMPORTANCE With an average annual incidence of 13.1 cases/100,000 individuals, salmonellosis has been deemed a nationally notifiable condition in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Earlier studies demonstrated that Salmonella is transmitted by a subset of animals (supershedders). The supershedder phenotype can be induced by antibiotics, ascertaining an essential role for the gut microbiota in Salmonella transmission. Consequently, modulation of the gut microbiota and modification of the intestinal microenvironment could assist in preventing animal colonization by the pathogen. Our study demonstrated that a manipulation of the chicken gut microbiota by the administration of an attenuated Salmonella strain or prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can promote resistance to Salmonella colonization via increases of beneficial microorganisms that translate into a less hospitable gut microenvironment.","[Azcarate-Peril, M.

How the gut microbiome structure of these animals will change in response receives increasing attention. The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi), a typic subterranean rodent endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, spends almost the whole life underground and is well adapted to the environmental pressures of both plateau and underground. However, how the gut microbiome of the plateau zokor will change in response to captivity has not been reported to date. This study compared the microbial community structure and functions of 22 plateau zokors before (the WS group) and after being kept in captivity for 15 days (the LS group, fed on carrots) using the 16S rRNA gene via high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the LS group retained 973 of the 977 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the WS group, and no new OTUs were found in the LS group. The dominant bacterial phyla were Bacteroides and Firmicutes in both groups. In alpha diversity analysis, the Shannon, Sobs, and ACE indexes of the LS group were significantly lower than those of the WS group. A remarkable difference (P < 0.01) between groups was also detected in beta diversity analysis. The UPGMA clustering, NMDS, PCoA, and Anosim results all showed that the intergroup difference was significantly greater than the intragroup difference. And compared with the WS group, the intragroup difference of the gut microbiota in the LS group was much larger, which failed to support the assumption that similar diets should drive convergence of gut microbial communities. PICRUSt revealed that although some functional categories displayed significant differences between groups, the relative abundances of these categories were very close in both groups. Based on all the results, we conclude that as plateau zokors enter captivity for a short time, although the relative abundances of different gut microbiota categories shifted significantly, they can maintain almost all the OTUs and the functions of the gut microbiota in the wild. So, the use of wild-caught plateau zokors in gut microbial studies is acceptable if the time in captivity is short.","[Liu, Daoxin; Song, Pengfei; Wang, Haijing; Cai, Zhenyuan; Zhang, Tongzuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810001, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Daoxin] Qinghai Univ, Kunlun Coll, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Daoxin; Song, Pengfei; Wang, Haijing; Cai, Zhenyuan; Zhang, Tongzuo] Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Daoxin; Song, Pengfei; Wang, Haijing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jingyan; Xie, Jiuxiang] Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, 251 Ningda Rd, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Qinghai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Qinghai University","Zhang, TZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810001, Qinghai, Peoples R China.;Xie, JX (corresponding author), Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, 251 Ningda Rd, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",xiejx@qhu.edu.cn; zhangtz@nwipb.cas.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760622]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0506405]; Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program [2019-SF-150]; Applied Basic Research Program of Qinghai Science and Technology Department [2019-ZJ-7069],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program; Applied Basic Research Program of Qinghai Science and Technology Department,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31760622); the National Key R&D Program of China (no. 2017YFC0506405); the Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program (no. 2019-SF-150), and the Applied Basic Research Program of Qinghai Science and Technology Department (2019-ZJ-7069).",,71,3,3,2,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1176-9343,,,EVOL BIOINFORM,Evol.

In a previous study, we showed that 59 species of birds displayed immense variation in their microbiomes and host (bird) taxonomy and ecology were most correlated with the gut microbiome. In this Frontiers Focused Review, I put those results in a broader context by discussing how collecting and analyzing wild microbiomes contributes to the main goals of evolutionary biology and the specific ways that birds are unique microbial hosts. Finally, I outline some of the methodological considerations for adding microbiome sampling to the research of wild animals and urge researchers to do so.

They have complex ecological adaptation mechanisms to adapt to perennial underground life. Intestinal microbes play an important role in the ecological adaptation of wild animals. The gut microbiota diversity and its function in short-faced moles' ecological adaptation is a scientific issue worth exploring. In this study, the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform was used to sequence the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA genes of 22 short-faced moles' intestinal samples to study the composition and functional structure of their intestinal microbiota. The results showed that in the short-faced moles' intestine, there are four main phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidete. At the family level, Peptostreptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae have the highest abundance. At the genus level, Romboutsia is the genus with the highest microbial abundance. According to the KEGG database, the main functions of short-faced mole gut microbes are metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and cellular processes. The function of short-faced mole intestinal microbiota is suitable for its long-term burrowing life. No gender difference is found in the composition and function of the short-faced mole intestinal microbiota. There are significant differences in the composition and functional structure of the short-faced mole gut microbiota between samples collected from different habitats.

Gut microbiota play a critical role in nutrition absorption and environmental adaptation and can affect the biological characteristics of host animals. The invasive golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) and native Chinese mud snail (Cipangopaludina chinensis) are two sympatric freshwater snails with similar ecological niche in southern China. However, gut microbiota comparison of interspecies remains unclear. Comparing the difference of gut microbiota between the invasive snail P. canaliculata and native snail C. chinensis could provide new insight into the invasion mechanism of P.canaliculata at the microbial level. Methods. Gut samples from 20 golden apple snails and 20 Chinese mud snails from wild freshwater habitats were collected and isolated. The 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region of the gut microbiota was analyzed using high throughput Illumina sequencing. Results. The gut microbiota dominantly composed of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Epsilonbacteraeota at phylum level in golden apple snail. Only Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in Chinese mud snail. Alpha diversity analysis (Shannon and Simpson indices) showed there were no significant differences in gut microbial diversity, but relative abundances of the two groups differed significantly (P < 0.05). Beta diversity analysis (Bray Curtis and weighted UniFrac distance) showed marked differences in the gut microbiota structure (P < 0.05). Unique or high abundance microbial taxa were more abundant in the invasive snail compared to the native form. Functional prediction analysis indicated that the relative abundances of functions differed significantly regarding cofactor prosthetic group electron carrier and vitamin biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis (P < 0.05). These results suggest an enhanced potential to adapt to new habitats in the invasive snail.","[Zhou, Zihao; Huang, Jinlong; Wu, Zhengjun] Guangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Minist Educ, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zihao; Huang, Jinlong; Wu, Zhengjun] Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zihao; Wu, Hongying; Li, Dinghong; Zeng, Wenlong; Huang, Jinlong; Wu, Zhengjun] Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Landscape Resources Conservat & S, Basin Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jinlong] Guangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China",Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Normal University,"Huang, JL; Wu, ZJ (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Minist Educ, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China.;Huang, JL; Wu, ZJ (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China.;Huang, JL; Wu, ZJ (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Landscape Resources Conservat & S, Basin Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China.;Huang, JL (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",jl_huang@163.com; wu_zhengjun@aliyun.com,"huang, jinlong/GLV-6716-2022","Huang, Jinlong/0000-0002-3730-7335",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31960280]; Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China [2018GXNSFAA294024]; Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talent Project [AD20159042]; Key Scientific Research Program of Guangxi Normal University [2017ZD009]; Guangxi Universities Foundation Promotion Project [2019KY0055],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China; Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talent Project; Key Scientific Research Program of Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Universities Foundation Promotion Project,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31960280) , Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 2018GXNSFAA294024) , Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talent Project (No. AD20159042) , Key Scientific Research Program of Guangxi Normal University (No. 2017ZD009) and Guangxi Universities Foundation Promotion Project (No. 2019KY0055) .

However, outside of dietary shifts, other potential environmental drivers of gut microbial composition have rarely been investigated, particularly in organisms living in their natural environments. Results Here, we generated the largest wild nonhuman primate gut microbiome dataset to date to identify the environmental drivers of gut microbial diversity and function in 758 samples collected from wild Ethiopian geladas (Theropithecus gelada). Because geladas live in a cold, high-altitude environment and have a low-quality grass-based diet, they face extreme thermoregulatory and energetic constraints. We tested how proxies of food availability (rainfall) and thermoregulatory stress (temperature) predicted gut microbiome composition of geladas. The gelada gut microbiome composition covaried with rainfall and temperature in a pattern that suggests distinct responses to dietary and thermoregulatory challenges. Microbial changes were driven by differences in the main components of the diet across seasons: in rainier periods, the gut was dominated by cellulolytic/fermentative bacteria that specialized in digesting grass, while during dry periods the gut was dominated by bacteria that break down starches found in underground plant parts. Temperature had a comparatively smaller, but detectable, effect on the gut microbiome. During cold and dry periods, bacterial genes involved in energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism increased, suggesting a stimulation of fermentation activity in the gut when thermoregulatory and nutritional stress co-occurred, and potentially helping geladas to maintain energy balance during challenging periods. Conclusion Together, these results shed light on the extent to which gut microbiota plasticity provides dietary and metabolic flexibility to the host, and might be a key factor to thriving in changing environments. On a longer evolutionary timescale, such metabolic flexibility provided by the gut microbiome may have also allowed members of Theropithecus to adopt a specialized diet, and colonize new high-altitude grassland habitats in East Africa.","[Baniel, Alice; Lu, Amy] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Beehner, Jacinta C.; Bergman, Thore J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Beehner, Jacinta C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bergman, Thore J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mercer, Arianne; Sams, Sierra; Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Perlman, Rachel F.; Petrullo, Lauren] SUNY Stony Brook, Interdept Doctoral Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Reitsema, Laurie] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolut & Med, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Northwestern University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Baniel, A; Lu, A (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;Snyder-Mackler, N (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",alice.baniel@gmail.com; amy.lu@stonybrook.edu; nsnyderm@asu.edu,"Snyder-Mackler, Noah/N-7395-2013","Snyder-Mackler, Noah/0000-0003-3026-6160; Perlman, Rachel/0000-0002-8129-122X; Baniel, Alice/0000-0001-7142-5864","National Science Foundation [BCS-1723228, BCS-1723237, BCS-2010309, BCS-0715179, BCS-1732231, IOS-1255974, IOS-1854359]; L.S.B.

It is, therefore, imperative that we understand the consequences of and mechanisms by which, species can respond to it. In recent years, research has shown that plasticity of the gut microbiome may be an important mechanism by which animals can adapt to environmental change, yet empirical evidence of this in wild non-model species remains sparse. Using an empirical replicated study system, we show that city life alters the gut microbiome and stable isotope profiling of a wild native non-model species - the eastern water dragon (Intellagama lesueurii) in Queensland, Australia. City dragons exhibit a more diverse gut microbiome than their native habitat counterparts and show gut microbial signatures of a high fat and plant rich diet. Additionally, we also show that city dragons have elevated levels of the Nitrogen-15 isotope in their blood suggesting that a city diet, which incorporates novel anthropogenic food sources, may also be richer in protein. These results highlight the role that gut microbial plasticity plays in an animals' response to human-altered landscapes.","[Littleford-Colquhoun, Bethan L.; Kent, Nicola; Frere, Celine H.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Global Change Ecol Res Grp, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Weyrich, Laura S.] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Dept Genet & Evolut, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Weyrich, Laura S.] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Adelaide; University of Wollongong,"Littleford-Colquhoun, BL (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.",Bethan.Littleford-Colquhoun@research.usc.edu.au,"Littleford-Colquhoun, Bethan/AAG-1821-2019; Frere, Celine Henria/B-4905-2013; Jackson, Nicola/AAE-8390-2021; Frere, Celine Henria/GYJ-3882-2022","Littleford-Colquhoun, Bethan/0000-0002-2594-0061; Frere, Celine Henria/0000-0002-9671-2138; Jackson, Nicola/0000-0002-3082-6829; Weyrich, Laura/0000-0001-5243-4634",,,,,97,16,16,8,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Here, we controlled for these other confounding factors in our investigation of the magnitude of the effect of diet on the gut microbiome assemblies of nonpasserine birds. We collected fecal samples, at one point in time, from 35 species of birds in a single zoo as well as 6 species of domestic poultry from farms in Guangzhou city to minimize the influences from interfering factors. Specifically, we describe 16S rRNA amplicon data from 129 fecal samples obtained from 41 species of birds, with additional shotgun metagenomic sequencing data generated from 16 of these individuals. Our data show that diets containing native starch increase the abundance of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiome, while those containing plantderived fiber mainly enrich the level of Clostridium. Greater numbers of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria are detected in carnivorous birds, while in birds fed a commercial cornsoybean basal diet, a stronger inner-connected microbial community containing Clostridia and Bacteroidia was enriched. Furthermore, the metagenome functions of the microbes (such as lipid metabolism and amino acid synthesis) were adapted to the different food types to achieve a beneficial state for the host. In conclusion, the covariation of diet and gut microbiome identified in our study demonstrates a modulation of the gut microbiome by dietary diversity and helps us better understand how birds live based on dietmicrobiome-host interactions. IMPORTANCE Our study identified food source, rather than host phylogeny, as the main factor modulating the gut microbiome diversity of nonpasserine birds, after minimizing the effects of other complex interfering factors such as weather, season, and geography. Adaptive evolution of microbes to food types formed a dietary-microbiomehost interaction reciprocal state. The covariation of diet and gut microbiome, including the response of microbiota assembly to diet in structure and function, is important for health and nutrition in animals. Our findings help resolve the major modulators of gut microbiome diversity in nonpasserine birds, which had not previously been well studied. The diet-microbe interactions and cooccurrence patterns identified in our study may be of special interest for future health assessment and conservation in birds.","[Xiao, Kangpeng; Shen, Yongyi] Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Kangpeng; Fan, Yutan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shen, Xuejuan; Li, Xiaobing; Liang, Xianghui; Bi, Ran; Shen, Yongyi] South China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yajiang; Zhai, Junqiong; Dai, Junwei; Chen, Wu] Guangzhou Zoo, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Irwin, David M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Irwin, David M.] Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Diabet Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shen, Yongyi] Key Lab Zoonosis Prevent & Control Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture; South China Agricultural University; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Shen, YY (corresponding author), Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Shen, YY (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Chen, W (corresponding author), Guangzhou Zoo, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Shen, YY (corresponding author), Key Lab Zoonosis Prevent & Control Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",guangzhouchenwu@sina.com; shenyy@scau.edu.cn,"li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022; li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Shen, Yongyi/GWU-8031-2022; Xiao, Kangpeng/HPE-2529-2023; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023","Xiao, Kangpeng/0000-0002-8421-7084; ","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2020B0301030007]; Guangdong Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Program [2019TX05N098]; 111 Project [D20008]; Department of Education of Guangdong Province [2019KZDXM004, 2019KCXTD001]; Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province [2020B1111320002]; Department of Agriculture of Guangdong Province","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research; Guangdong Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Program; 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); Department of Education of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province; Department of Agriculture of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (no. 2020B0301030007) , Guangdong Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Program (2019TX05N098) , the 111 Project (D20008) , and funds from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province (2019KZDXM004 and 2019KCXTD001) , Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (2020B1111320002) , and Department of Agriculture of Guangdong Province.",,69,14,14,13,50,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",,2379-5042,,MSPHERE,mSphere,MAY-JUN,2021,6,3,,,,,,,e00308-21,10.1128/mSphere.00308-21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00308-21,,,13,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,SD8QM,33980682,Green Published,,,2023-06-01,WOS:000651640900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reintroduction, as an effective strategy for wild population recovery and genetic diversity maintenance for endangered populations, usually takes captive populations as rewilding resource. While, little is known about the compositional and functional differences of gut microbiota between captive and wild populations, especially for large carnivores, like Amur tiger. In this study, high throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (amplicon sequencing) and metagenomics were used to analyze the composition and function variations of gut microbiota communities between captive and wild Amur tiger populations based on total 35 fecal samples (13 from captive tigers and 22 from wild tigers). Our results showed that captive Amur tigers have higher alpha diversity in gut microbiota, but that the average unweighted UniFrac distance of bacterial taxa among wild Amur tigers was much larger. The function differences involve most aspects of the body functions, especially for metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems. It was indicated that the diet habit and environment difference between captive and wild populations lead to composition differences of gut microbiota and then resulted in significant differences in functions. These contrasts of functional and compositional variations in gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur tigers are essential insights for guiding conservation management and policy decision-making, and call for more attention on the influence of gut microbiota on the ability of captive animals to survive in the wild.","[Ning, Yao; Qi, Jinzhe; Liang, Xin; Wang, Jingxuan; Chen, Shiyu; Ma, Jianzhang; Jiang, Guangshun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Qi, Jinzhe] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Dobbins, Michael T.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Northeast Forestry University - China; Northeast Forestry University - China; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ma, JZ; Jiang, GS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China.",jianzhangma@163.com; jgshun@126.com,"Qi, Jinzhe/ABC-4601-2022","Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; NSFC [31572285, 31872241]; project of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); project of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration","This study was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017PZ14), the National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0503200) and NSFC (31572285; 31872241), and project of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, entitled Survey Standard Compiling and Information Summary of Amur Tiger and Leopard Population and Habitat.",,74,26,26,15,52,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

However, the factors that drive individual microbiota variation in wild animals and to what extent these are predictable or idiosyncratic across populations remains poorly understood. Here, we use a multi-population dataset from a common rodent species (the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus), to test whether a consistent core gut microbiota is identifiable in this species, and to what extent the predictors of microbiota variation are consistent across populations. Between 2014 and 2018 we used capture-mark-recapture and 16S rRNA profiling to intensively monitor two wild wood mouse populations and their gut microbiota, as well as characterising the microbiota from a laboratory-housed colony of the same species. Although the microbiota was broadly similar at high taxonomic levels, the two wild populations did not share a single bacterial amplicon sequence variant (ASV), despite being only 50km apart. Meanwhile, the laboratory-housed colony shared many ASVs with one of the wild populations from which it is thought to have been founded decades ago. Despite not sharing any ASVs, the two wild populations shared a phylogenetically more similar microbiota than either did with the colony, and the factors predicting compositional variation in each wild population were remarkably similar. We identified a strong and consistent pattern of seasonal microbiota restructuring that occurred at both sites, in all years, and within individual mice. While the microbiota was highly individualised, some seasonal convergence occurred in late winter/early spring. These findings reveal highly repeatable seasonal gut microbiota dynamics in multiple populations of this species, despite different taxa being involved. This provides a platform for future work to understand the drivers and functional implications of such predictable seasonal microbiome restructuring, including whether it might provide the host with adaptive seasonal phenotypic plasticity.",,,,k.j.marsh@exeter.ac.uk,"Venkatesan, Saudamini/AAD-4635-2020; Troitsky, Tanya/HJI-5312-2023","Venkatesan, Saudamini/0000-0003-2322-3170; Troitsky, Tanya/0000-0001-8394-6229; Marsh, Kirsty/0000-0002-0515-9518; Webster, Joanne P./0000-0001-8616-4919; Pedersen, Amy/0000-0002-1385-1360",,,,,67,2,2,8,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Here, DNA from faecal samples was used to investigate the gut microbial compositions and diversity in three host species endemic to the high-altitude Tibetan plateau, the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii, T-antelope, 4300 m) and the Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang, T-ass, 4300 m), and in the Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries, T-sheep) collected from two different altitudes (T-sheep [k], 4300 m and T-sheep [I] 3000 m). Ordinary sheep (O. aries, sheep) from low altitudes (1800 m) were used for comparison. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the genera Ruminococcus (22.78%), Oscillospira (20.00%), and Clostridium (10.00%) were common taxa in all high-altitude species (T-antelope, T-ass and T-sheep [k]). Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, Clostridia, and Firmicutes showed greater enrichment in the T-antelopes' gut microbiota than in the microbiota of lower-altitude sheep (T-sheep [1] and sheep). The T-antelopes' gut microbiota displayed a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes than lower-altitude sheep (T-sheep [1] and sheep). A functional capacity analysis of the paired-end metagenomics sequences of the gut metagenomes of high-altitude T-antelopes and T-sheep annotated over 80% of the unique genes to metabolism (especially carbohydrate metabolism pathways) and genetic information processing in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. The gut metagenome of the T-antelope may have co-evolved with the host genomes (e.g. glycolysis and DNA repair). The higher-altitude herbivores tended to have similar gut microbial compositions, with similar functional capacities, suggesting that their gut microbiota could involved in their high-altitude adaptation.

Certain host traits can influence which microbial taxa comprise the microbiota. One potentially important trait in vertebrate animals is the adaptive immune system, which has been hypothesized to act as an ecological filter, promoting the presence of some microbial taxa over others. Here we surveyed the intestinal microbiota of 68 wild-type zebrafish, with functional adaptive immunity, and 61 rag1(-) zebrafish, lacking functional B- and T-cell receptors, to test the role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the intestinal microbiota. In addition, we tested the robustness of adaptive immunity's filtering effects to host-host interaction by comparing the microbiota of fish populations segregated by genotype to those containing both genotypes. The presence of adaptive immunity individualized the gut microbiota and decreased the contributions of neutral processes to gut microbiota assembly. Although mixing genotypes led to increased phylogenetic diversity in each, there was no significant effect of adaptive immunity on gut microbiota composition in either housing condition. Interestingly, the most robust effect on microbiota composition was co-housing within a tank. In all, these results suggest that adaptive immunity has a role as an ecological filter of the zebrafish gut microbiota, but it can be overwhelmed by other factors, including transmission of microbes among hosts.","[Stagaman, Keaton; Burns, Adam R.; Bohannan, Brendan J.

Considering the vital role of intestinal microbiota in nutrient metabolism, immunity, neuroregulation, and curing of disease, animal intestinal microbiota have become a research hotspot in conservation biology. The intestinal microbiota of mammals are dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The avian gut microbiota are similar to those of mammals at the phylum level and primarily consist of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes dominated the bacterial communities of the insect gut. However, relatively little research has been conducted on reptiles, particularly snakes. In this study, the composition of the intestinal microbial community and its ecological adaptation were investigated in the different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of Lycodon rufozonatus specimens. We found that microbial diversity was higher in the stomach than that in the small and large intestines, and the microbes were involved in metabolic processes. Our results provide insights into the comprehensive understanding of the evolution and ecology of snakes and the formulation of conservation measures for these animals. The gastrointestinal tract of animals contains microbiota, forming a complex microecosystem. Gut microbes and their metabolites can regulate the development of host innate and adaptive immune systems. Animal immune systems maintain intestinal symbiotic microbiota homeostasis. However, relatively few studies have been published on reptiles, particularly snakes, and even fewer studies on different parts of the digestive tracts of these animals. Herein, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the microbial community composition and adaptability in the stomach and small and large intestines of Lycodon rufozonatus. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were most abundant in the stomach; Fusobacteria in the small intestine; and Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes in the large intestine. No dominant genus could be identified in the stomach; however, dominant genera were evident in the small and large intestines. The microbial diversity index was significantly higher in the stomach than in the small and large intestines. Moreover, the influence of the microbial community structure on function was clarified through function prediction. Collectively, the gut microbes in the different segments of the digestive tract revealed the unique features of the L. rufozonatus gut microbiome. Our results provide insights into the co-evolutionary relationship between reptile gut microbiota and their hosts.","[Shang, Yongquan; Liu, Gang; Wang, Xibao; Wu, Xiaoyang; Wei, Qinguo; Shi, Lupeng; Zhang, Honghai] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Huaming] Shangqiu Normal Univ, Coll Biol & Food, Shangqiu 476000, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University; Shangqiu Normal University,"Zhang, HH (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Peoples R China.",zhanghonghai67@126.com,,"Wang, Xibao/0000-0002-2036-5184; Liu, Gang/0000-0003-0730-7374",,,,,76,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,FEB,2023,13,4,,,,,,,731,10.3390/ani13040731,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani13040731,,,19,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,9G2LA,36830518,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000937989400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a harsh environment characterized by low temperature, high altitude and hypoxia, although some native mammals may adapt well to the extreme climate. However, how animal gut microbial community structure and function adapt to extreme cold climates is not well understood. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is an ideal animal model with which to study the effects of climate change on host adaptation by studing intestinal microorganisms. Here, we used 16S rRNA sequencing technology combined with physiological methods to investigate plateau pika gut microbiota in summer and winter. Due to limited diet resources, the pikas in winter have a lower ability of degradation and fermentation for plant-based food (reduced cellulase activity and total short-chain fatty acids) by decreasing gut microbial diversity and some functional microbes, such as fiber-degrading bacteria Oscillospira and Treponema. Metagenomic prediction showed that most of those gene functions associated with metabolism (e.g. energy metabolism and lipid metabolism) were less abundant in winter, implying that the plateau pika slows diet fermentation and weakens energy requirements in the cold season.

Specifically, 16S rRNA gene and bifidobacterial Internally Transcribed Spacer (ITS) profiling were employed to reconstruct and then compare the canine core gut microbiota to those of wolves and humans, revealing that artificial selection and subsequent cohabitation of dogs with their owners influenced the microbial population of canine gut through loss and acquisition of specific bacterial taxa. Moreover, comparative analysis of the intestinal bacterial population of dogs fed on Bones and Raw Food (BARF) or commercial food (CF) diet, coupled with shotgun metagenomics, highlighted that both bacterial composition and metabolic repertoire of the canine gut microbiota have evolved to adapt to high-protein or high-carbohydrates intake.

Because of human interference, the survival of wild animals is threatened in the face of competition, particularly in co-inhabited grazing pastures. This may lead to differences in the adaptability between wild and domestic animals, as well as nutritional deficiencies in wild animals. The gut microbiota is closely associated with host health, nutrition, and adaptability. However, the gut microbiota diversity and functions in domestic and wild animals in co-inhabited areas are unclear. To reveal the adaptability of wild and domestic animals in co-inhabited areas based on gut microbiota, we assessed the gut microbiota diversity. This study was based on the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA and gut microbiota functions according to the metagenome analysis of fresh fecal samples in wild goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) in the Qaidam Basin. The wild and domestic species showed significant differences in alpha- and beta-diversities. Specifically, the alpha-diversity was lower in goitered gazelles. We speculated that the nutritional and habitat status of the goitered gazelles were worse. The gut microbiota functions in the gazelles were enriched in metabolism and cellular processes based on the KEGG database. In summary, we reasoned that gut microbiota can improve the adaptability of goitered gazelles through energy maintenance by the functions of gut microbiota in the face of nutritional deficiencies. These findings highlight the importance of gut microbiota diversity to improve the adaptability of goitered gazelles, laying a foundation for the conservation of wild goitered gazelles. In addition, we further provide management suggestions for domestic sheep in co-inhabited grazing pastures.","[Qin, Wen; Song, Pengfei; Huang, YanGan; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Tongzuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Peoples R China; [Qin, Wen; Song, Pengfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Gonghua] Jinggangshan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jian, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaowen] Lanzhou Zoo, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Shengqing] Qinghai Univ, Qinghai Acad Anim Sci & Vet Med, Xining, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tongzuo] Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Jinggangshan University; Qinghai University","Zhang, TZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Peoples R China.;Zhang, TZ (corresponding author), Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Peoples R China.",zhangtz@nwipb.cas.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23060602, XDA2002030302]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0506405]; Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program [2019-SF-150]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key R&D Program of China; Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program,This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23060602 and XDA2002030302); the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0506405); and the Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program (2019-SF-150).,,131,12,14,11,39,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota also has a close relationship with reproduction. The wild ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus) is a typical seasonal breeding animal. The purpose of this study was to explore the distinct taxonomy and function of the gut microbiota in the breeding and non-breeding seasons of the wild ground squirrel using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The results show that the taxonomy of gut microbiota was different between the breeding season and non-breeding season. Functional prediction of the gut microbiota indicated that the relative abundance of metabolic pathways was differentially enriched between the breeding season and non-breeding season. This study further revealed the potential relationship between gut microbiota and reproduction and expanded our understanding of the function of gut microbiota. At the same time, it provided a new direction for research on the breeding strategy of seasonal breeding animals. Seasonal breeding is a normal phenomenon in which animals adapt to natural selection and reproduce only in specific seasons. Large studies have reported that the gut microbiota is closely related to reproduction. The purpose of this study was to explore the distinct taxonomy and function of the gut microbiota in the breeding and non-breeding seasons of the wild ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus). The 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was utilized to sequence the gut microbiota of the wild ground squirrel. PICRUSt analysis was also applied to predict the function of the gut microbiota. The results suggested that the main components of the gut microbiota in all samples were Firmicutes (61.8%), Bacteroidetes (32.4%), and Proteobacteria (3.7%). Microbial community composition analyses revealed significant differences between the breeding and non-breeding seasons. At the genus level, Alistipes, Mycoplasma, Anaerotruncus, and Odoribacter were more abundant in the non-breeding season, while Blautia and Streptococcus were more abundant in the breeding season. The results of a functional prediction suggested that the relative abundance of functional categories that were related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism increased in the breeding season. The relative abundance of energy metabolism, transcription, and signal transduction increased in the non-breeding season.

We studied the gut microbiota composition and function of the wild rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using 16S rRNA sequencing method. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota of the wild rhesus macaques was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were higher during the dry season than the rainy season. Specifically, higher proportions of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and unclassified bacteria at the phylum level and moreCoprococcusat the genus level were detected in the dry season. Predictive functional analysis showed that pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism and drug resistance (antimicrobial and antineoplastic) were richer in the dry season. These seasonal differences in microbiota could be due to their heavier dependence on leaf-based diet in the dry season. Additionally, macaques in limestone forests had a higher percentage of Spirochaetes, probably suggesting that the proportion of fruits in dietary composition also play an important role in the gut microbiota. We concluded that diet was strongly linked to the diversity, composition, and function of the gut microbiota in the wild groups of rhesus macaques living in the limestone forest, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota of macaques and the need to conduct further study on the adaptation strategy in response of environmental changes in the ground of gut microbiota.","[Li, Yuhui; Chen, Ting; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuhui; Chen, Ting; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, 15 Yu Cai Rd, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jipeng] Adm Ctr Guangxi Chongzuo White Headed Langur Natl, Chongzuo, Peoples R China",Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Normal University,"Li, YB; Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Guilin, Peoples R China.;Li, YB; Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, 15 Yu Cai Rd, Guilin, Peoples R China.",lyb_2001@126.com; hzh773@126.com,,"Huang, Zhonghao/0000-0003-2342-0908","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31660616, 31960106, 31960104]; Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China [2018GXNSFAA281029]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31660616, 31960106, 31960104) and the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China (2018GXNSFAA281029).",,78,4,4,11,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0302-8933,1432-072X,,ARCH MICROBIOL,Arch.

The gut microbiota is important in the adaptive strategies of wild herbivores, and herbivores will contact the soil microbiota when they are feeding. However, there are no studies about the effects of soil microbiota on the gut microbiota of wild herbivores. Understanding the seasonal adaptive strategies of wild herbivores based on their gut microbiota and the effects of soil microbiota on the herbivorous gut microbiota is indispensable for making optimal conservation recommendations. To address those issues, we compared the diversity and functions of gut microbiota in goitered gazelles between winter and summer with a non-invasive fecal sampling method from the Qaidam Basin based on 16S rRNA V3-V4 regions. The data showed that seasonal variations caused the significant changes in gut microbiota at alpha-and beta-diversity levels. The main gut microbial function was Metabolism. It showed significant seasonal changes. The goitered gazelles adapted to the seasonal changes by increasing the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Christensenellaceae, Bacteroides and the function about Metabolism in the winter to improve the adaptability. We also compared the effects of soil microbiota on the gut microbiota between winter and summer, covering source tracking analysis and the seasonal differences in ecological assembly processes. The contribution of soil microbiota on the gut microbiota of goitered gazelles was 5.3095% and 15.6347% in winter and summer, respectively, which was greater than on species of animals living underground. Seasonal variation also influenced the ecological processes of microbiota both in the gut and soil. Due to the differences in environments, the ecological processes between fecal microbiota and soil microbiota showed significant differences, and they were dominated by stochastic processes and deterministic processes, respectively. The soil microbiota has contributed to the gut microbiota, but not a decisive factor. Our research laid the foundation on the seasonal and soil microbiota effects on the adaptive strategies of goitered gazelles, and is the first study to explain the soil microbiota influence on the gut microbiota of wild herbivores.","[Qin, Wen] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining, Peoples R China; [Song, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shoudong] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary,Mini, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shoudong] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, Rudi Drent Chair Global Flyway Ecol, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen, Netherlands",Qinghai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Fudan University; University of Groningen,"Zhang, SD (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary,Mini, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SD (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, Rudi Drent Chair Global Flyway Ecol, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen, Netherlands.",zhangshoudong666@163.com,,,,,,,65,0,0,29,35,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

This can generate signals of phylosymbiosis, whereby gut microbiome composition matches host phylogenetic structure. However, the genetic mechanisms that generate phylosymbiosis and the scale at which they act remain unclear. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are that phylosymbiosis is driven by immunogenetic regions such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) controlling microbial composition, or by spatial structuring of neutral host genetic diversity via founder effects, genetic drift, or isolation by distance. Alternatively, associations between microbes and host phylogeny may be generated by their spatial autocorrelation across landscapes, rather than the direct effects of host genetics. In this study, we collected MHC, microsatellite, and gut microbiome data from separate individuals belonging to the Galapagos mockingbird species complex, which consists of four allopatrically distributed species. We applied multiple regression with distance matrices and Bayesian inference to test for correlations between average genetic and microbiome similarity across nine islands for which all three levels of data were available. Clustering of individuals by species was strongest when measured with microsatellite markers and weakest for gut microbiome distributions, with intermediate clustering of MHC allele frequencies. We found that while correlations between island-averaged gut microbiome composition and both microsatellite and MHC dissimilarity existed across species, these relationships were greatly weakened when accounting for geographic distance. Overall, our study finds little support for large-scale control of gut microbiome composition by neutral or adaptive genetic regions across closely related bird phylogenies, although this does not preclude the possibility that host genetics shapes gut microbiome at the individual level.","[Fleischer, Ramona; Risely, Alice; Sommer, Simone] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany; [Hoeck, Paquita E.

Both captive and wild forest musk deer showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, although significant differences were found in their relative abundances between both groups. alpha-Diversity results showed that no significant differences occurred in the microbiota between both groups, while beta-diversity results showed that significant differences did occur in their microbiota compositions.

Yet studies in wild animals rarely compare multiple populations that differ ecologically, which is the level at which local adaptation may occur. Further, few studies simultaneously characterize diet and gut microbiome from the same sample, despite their probable interdependence. Here, we investigate the interplay between diet and gut microbiome in three geographically isolated populations of the critically endangered Grauer's gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), which we show to be genetically differentiated. We find population- and social group-specific dietary and gut microbial profiles and covariation between diet and gut microbiome, despite the presence of core microbial taxa. There was no detectable effect of age, and only marginal effects of sex and genetic relatedness on the microbiome. Diet differed considerably across populations, with the high-altitude population consuming a lower diversity of plants compared to low-altitude populations, consistent with plant availability constraining dietary choices. The observed pattern of covariation between diet and gut microbiome is probably a result of long-term social and environmental factors.

Gut microbiota plays a key role in the survival and reproduction of wild animals which rely on microbiota to break down plant compounds for nutrients. As compared to laboratory animals, wild animals face much more threat of environmental changes (e.g. food shortages and risk of infection). Therefore, studying the gut microbiota of wild animals can help us better understand the mechanisms animals use to adapt to their environment. Methods. We collected the feces of Brandt's voles in the grassland, of three age groups (juvenile, adult and old), in both sexes. We studied the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results. The main members of gut microbiota in Brandt's voles were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. As voles get older, the proportion of Firmicutes increased gradually, and the proportion of Bacteroides decreased gradually. The diversity of the microbiota of juveniles is lower, seems like there is still a lot of space for colonization, and there are large variations in the composition of the microbiome between individuals. In adulthood, the gut microbiota tends to be stable, and the diversity is highest. In adult, the abundances of Christensenellaceae and Peptococcus of female were significantly higher than male voles. Conclusions. The gut microbiota of Brandt's vole was influenced by sex and age, probably due to growth needs and hormone levels. Gut microbiota of wild animals were much influenced by their life-history reflected by their age and sex. Future studies will be directed to identify functions of these wild microbiota'' in regulating physiological or behavioral processes of wild animals in different life stage or sexes.","[Xu, Xiaoming; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiaoming; Zhang, Zhibin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Biot Interact, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Biot Interact, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,"Zhang, Zhibin/0000-0003-2090-7999",Key projects of International Cooperation Bureau of Chinese Academy of Sciences [152111KYSB20160089]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31700344],Key projects of International Cooperation Bureau of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Key projects of International Cooperation Bureau of Chinese Academy of Sciences (152111KYSB20160089) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31700344).

The giant panda is a flagship species for the conservation of wildlife. With integrated efforts including captive breeding, this species has been recently upgraded from endangered to vulnerable (IUCN 2016). Since a large proportion (21.8%) of their global population is still captive, it is critical to understand how captivity changes the gut microbiome of these pandas and how such alterations to the microbiome might affect their future fitness and potential impact on the ecosystem after release into the wild. Here, we use 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) marker gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics sequencing to demonstrate that the fecal microbiomes differ substantially between wild and captive giant pandas. Fecal microbiome diversity was significantly lower in captive pandas, as was the diversity of functional genes. Additionally, captive pandas have reduced functional potential for cellulose degradation but enriched metabolic pathways for starch metabolism, indicating that they may not adapt to a wild diet after being released into the wild since a major component of their diet in the wild will be bamboo. Most significantly, we observed a significantly higher level of amylase activity but a lower level of cellulase activity in captive giant panda feces than those of wild giant pandas, shown by an in vitro experimental assay. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors, as well as heavy metal tolerance genes were enriched in the microbiomes of captive pandas, which raises a great concern of spreading these genes to other wild animals and ecosystems when they are released into a wild environment. Our results clearly show that captivity has altered the giant panda microbiome, which could have unintended negative consequences on their adaptability and the ecosystem during the reintroduction of giant pandas into the wild.","[Guo, Wei; Mishra, Sudhanshu; Ning, Ruihong; Kong, Fanli; Zeng, Bo; Li, Ying] Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat Key, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Wei] Chengdu Med Coll, Sch Lab Med, Sichuan Prov EngineeringLab Prevent & Control Tec, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chengdong; Zhang, Hemin] China Conservat & Res Ctr Giant Panda, Yaan 611830, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiangchao] Univ Arkansas, Dept Anim Sci, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Sichuan Agricultural University; Chengdu Medical College; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat Key, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Zhao, JC (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Anim Sci, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",guochina2005@126.com; mishra.sudhanshu30@gmail.com; wang_2019pandas@sina.com; zhang_2019pandas@sina.com; about2006@163.com; kfl229@163.com; apollobovey@163.com; jzhao77@uark.edu; yingli@sicau.edu.cn,"MISHRA, SUDHANSHU/E-6732-2011","Zeng, Bo/0000-0001-7482-7340; MISHRA, SUDHANSHU/0000-0003-3789-7571",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471997]; Financial Allocation Fund Project of the State Forestry Administration in China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Financial Allocation Fund Project of the State Forestry Administration in China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31900307) to W.G., and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31471997) to Y.L., and the Financial Allocation Fund Project of the State Forestry Administration in China to C.W.",,73,42,47,9,64,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4425,,GENES-BASEL,Genes,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,827,10.3390/genes10100827,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes10100827,,,17,Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Genetics & Heredity,JP6UA,31635158,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000498397100098,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many zoos provide research sites for biological scientists to reintroduce animals, especially those facing extinction. Therefore, to prevent the extinction of wild animals, captive wild animals have become one of the ways to protect threatened taxa. Monitoring the structure and function of the gut microbiota of captive animals can help elucidate whether animals have adapted to their artificial environment, which is one of the key issues in wildlife conservation. This study investigated the gut microbiota of blue sheep and red deer at different growth stages and inter-species. The result shows gut microbiota of blue sheep and red deer will change to some extent in different growth stages, but the dominant flora remains stable. In blue sheep and red deer, the gut microbiota differ significantly between species. In addition, several potentially pathogenic microbial communities were identified based on the current findings. The study highlights key gut microbiota across species and ages. Blue sheep and red deer, second-class key protected animals in China, are sympatric species with a high degree of overlap of food resources in the Helan Mountains, China. Previous studies with blue sheep and red deer in nature have shown that their physiology is closely related to their gut microbiota. However, growth stages and changes occurring in these species in captivity are still unknown. Thus, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to explore diversity, composition and function of the gut microbiota in these two animal species. The diversity and structure of the gut microbiota in captive blue sheep and red deer changed at different growth stages, but the dominant microbiota phyla in the gut microbiota remained stable, which was composed of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. Moreover, gut microbiota diversity in juvenile blue sheep and red deer was low, with the potential for further colonization. Functional predictions showed differences such as red deer transcription being enriched in adults, and blue sheep adults having a higher cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis than juveniles. Microbial changes between blue sheep and red deer at different growth stages and between species mainly depend on the abundance of the microbiota, rather than the increase and absence of the bacterial taxa.","[Zhao, Yao; Hayat Khattak, Romaan; Teng, Liwei; Liu, Zhensheng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jia] Liaoning Wildlife Protect & Epidem Dis Monitoring, Dalian 116013, Peoples R China; [Ding, Mengqi] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China; [Hayat Khattak, Romaan] Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Guangzhou 510260, Peoples R China; [Teng, Liwei; Liu, Zhensheng] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Conservat Biol, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China","Northeast Forestry University - China; Harbin Institute of Technology; Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences","Teng, LW; Liu, ZS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.;Teng, LW; Liu, ZS (corresponding author), Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Conservat Biol, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China.",tenglw1975@163.com; zhenshengliu@163.com,,"Khattak, Romaan Hayat/0000-0002-8047-1835",,,,,89,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,FEB,2023,13,4,,,,,,,553,10.3390/ani13040553,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani13040553,,,20,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,9G3WX,36830340,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000938087900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At present, little is known about the mechanism of animal gut microbiota in host adaptation to high altitude environments. Here, we selected wild macaques, humans, and dogs with different levels of kinship and intimate relationships in high altitude and low altitude environments, and analyzed the response of their gut microbiota to the host diet and altitude environments. Alpha diversity analysis found that at high altitude, the gut microbiota diversity of wild macaques with more complex diet in the wild environments is much higher than that of humans and dogs with simpler diet (p < 0.05), and beta diversity analysis found that the UniFrac distance between humans and dogs was significantly lower than between humans and macaques (p < 0.05), indicating that diet strongly drive the convergence of gut microbiota among species. Meanwhile, alpha diversity analysis found that among three subjects, the gut microbiota diversity of high altitude population is higher than that of low altitude population (ACE index in three species, Shannon index in dog and macaque and Simpson index in dog, p < 0.05), and beta diversity analysis found that the UniFrac distances among the three subjects in the high altitude environments were significantly lower than in the low altitude environments (p < 0.05). Additionally, core shared ASVs analysis found that among three subjects, the number of core microbiota in high altitude environments is higher than in low altitude environments, up to 5.34 times (1,105/207), and the proportion and relative abundance of the core bacteria types in each species were significantly higher in high altitude environments than in low altitude environments (p < 0.05). The results showed that high altitude environments played an important role in driving the convergence of gut microbiota among species. Furthermore, the neutral community model trial found that the gut microbiota of the three subjects was dispersed much more at high altitude than at low altitude, implying that the gut microbiota convergence of animals at high altitudes may be partly due to the microbial transmission between hosts mediated by human activities.","[Zhao, Junsong; Yao, Yongfang; Dong, Mengmeng; Xiao, Hongtao; Xiong, Ying; Yang, Shengzhi; Xie, Meng; Xu, Huailiang] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yaan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Junsong] Zhaotong Univ, Coll Agron & Life Sci, Zhaotong, Peoples R China; [Li, Diyan] Chengdu Univ, Sch Pharm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ni, Qingyong; Zhang, Mingwang] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Zhaotong University; Chengdu University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Xu, HL (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yaan, Peoples R China.",xuhuail@sicau.edu.cn,,,,,,,67,0,0,10,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

The majority of these studies have focused on bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, while the fungal community has often been neglected. Gut anaerobic fungi of the class Neocallimastigomycetes are a vital part of the intestinal microbiome in many herbivorous animals and their exceptional abilities to degrade indigestible plant material means that they contribute significantly to fermentative processes in the enteric tract. Gorillas rely on a highly fibrous diet and depend on fermentative microorganisms to meet their daily energetic demands. To assess whether Neocallimastigomycetes occur in gorillas we analyzed 12 fecal samples from wild Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, and subjected potential anaerobic fungi sequences to phylogenetic analysis. The clone library contained ITS1 fragments that we related to 45 different fungi clones. Of these, 12 gastrointestinal fungi in gorillas are related to anaerobic fungi and our phylogenetic analyses support their assignment to the class Neocallimastigomycetes. As anaerobic fungi play a pivotal role in plant fiber degradation in the herbivore gut, gorillas might benefit from harboring these particular fungi with regard to their nutritional status. Future studies should investigate whether Neocallimastigomycetes are also found in other nonhuman primates with high fiber intake, which would also benefit from having such highly efficient fermentative microbes.","[Schulz, Doreen] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Schulz, Doreen; Vallo, Peter; Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Schulz, Doreen; Modry, David] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pathol & Parasitol, Brno 61242, Czech Republic; [Qablan, Moneeb A.] United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Food & Agr, Dept Vet Med, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Profousova-Psenkova, Ilona] Zool Garden Usti Nad Labem, Usti Nad Labem 40007, Czech Republic; [Vallo, Peter] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Fuh, Terence] World Wildlife Fund, Primate Habituat Project, Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, BP 1053, Bangui, Cent Afr Republ; [Modry, David] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, CEITEC VFU, Palackeho Tr 1946-1, Brno 61242, Czech Republic; [Modry, David; Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Biol, Inst Parasitol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Piel, Alexander K.; Stewart, Fiona] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Piel, Alexander K.; Stewart, Fiona] Ugalla Primate Project, Uvinza, Tanzania; [Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Liberec Zoo, Liberec 46001, Czech Republic; [Fliegerova, Katerina] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Anim Physiol & Genet, Prague 14220, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Veterinary Sciences Brno; United Arab Emirates University; Ulm University; University of Veterinary Sciences Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Liverpool John Moores University; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Animal Physiology & Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Schulz, D (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.;Schulz, D (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.;Schulz, D (corresponding author), Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pathol & Parasitol, Brno 61242, Czech Republic.",doreenschz@gmail.com,"Vallo, Peter/F-9650-2014; Modry, David/G-7815-2014; Petrzelkova, Klara Judita/G-7111-2014","Modry, David/0000-0001-9649-6255; Qablan, Moneeb/0000-0003-3678-5797; Stewart, Fiona/0000-0002-4929-4711",Leakey Foundation; project CEITEC (Central European Institute of Technology) from the European Regional Development Fund [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; European Social Fund; state budget of the Czech Republic [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0300];  [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000460 OP RDE],Leakey Foundation; project CEITEC (Central European Institute of Technology) from the European Regional Development Fund; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); state budget of the Czech Republic; ,"We are grateful to the government of the Central African Republic as well as the Ministre de l'Education Nationale, de l'Alphabetisation, de l'Enseignement Superieur, et de la Recherche for granting permission to conduct our research within the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic.

Strong adaptation deeply affects feral population's morphology and physiology, including the microbiota community. The gut microbiota is generally recognized to play a crucial role in maintaining host health and metabolism. To date, it is unclear whether feral populations' phylogeny, development stages or lifestyle have the greatest impact in shaping the gut microbiota, as well as how this can confer adaptability to new environments. Here, in order to deepen this point, we characterized the gut microbiota of feral population discriminating between juvenile and adult samples, and we compared it to the microbiota structure of wild boar and domestic pig as the references. Gut microbiota composition was estimated through the sequencing of the partial 16S rRNA gene by DNA metabarcoding and High Throughput Sequencing on DNA extracted from fecal samples.ResultsThe comparison of microbiota communities among the three forms showed significant differences. The feral form seems to carry some bacteria of both domestic pigs, derived from its ancestral condition, and wild boars, probably as a sign of a recent re-adaptation strategy to the natural environment. In addition, interestingly, feral pigs show some exclusive bacterial taxa, also suggesting an innovative nature of the evolutionary trajectories and an ecological segregation in feral populations, as already observed for other traits.ConclusionsThe feral pig showed a significant change between juvenile and adult microbiota suggesting an influence of the wild environment in which these populations segregate. However, it is important to underline that we certainly cannot overlook that these variations in the structure of the microbiota also depended on the different development stages of the animal, which in fact influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Concluding, the feral pigs represent a new actor living in the same geographical space as the wild boars, in which its gut microbial structure suggests that it is mainly the result of environmental segregation, most different from its closest relative. This gives rise to interesting fields of exploration regarding the changed ecological complexity and the consequent evolutionary destiny of the animal communities involved in this phenomenon.","[Petrelli, Simona; Buglione, Maria; Ricca, Ezio; Scala, Giovanni; Fulgione, Domenico] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol, Via Cinthia 26, I-80126 Naples, NA, Italy; [Rivieccio, Eleonora] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Humanities, Via Porta Massa 1, I-80133 Naples, NA, Italy; [Ricca, Ezio; Fulgione, Domenico] Univ Naples Federico II, Task Force Microbiome Studies, I-80100 Naples, NA, Italy; [Baccigalupi, Loredana] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Mol Med & Med Biotechnol, Via Pansini 5, I-80131 Naples, NA, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Fulgione, D (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol, Via Cinthia 26, I-80126 Naples, NA, Italy.;Fulgione, D (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Task Force Microbiome Studies, I-80100 Naples, NA, Italy.",fulgione@unina.it,"Buglione, Maria/ABH-1103-2021","Buglione, Maria/0000-0001-6022-707X",,,,,60,0,0,2,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2524-4671,,ANIM MICROBIOME,Anim.

The impacts of plateau environment on animal physiology and reproduction include external factors such as strong ultraviolet radiation and low temperature, and internal factors such as animal metabolites and gut microbiota. However, it remains unclear how plateau pika adapt to high altitudes through the combination of serum metabolites and gut microbiota. To this end, we captured 24 wild plateau pikas at the altitudes of 3400, 3600, or 3800 m a.s.l. in a Tibetan alpine grassland. Using the machine learning algorithms (random forest), we identified five biomarkers of serum metabolites indicative of the altitudes, that is, dihydrotestosterone, homo-l-arginine, alpha-ketoglutaric-acid, serotonin, and threonine, which were related to body weight, reproduction, and energy metabolism of pika. Those metabolic biomarkers were positively correlated with Lachnospiraceae_ Agathobacter, Ruminococcaceae, or Prevotellaceae_Prevotella, suggesting the close relationship between metabolites and gut microbiota. By identifying the metabolic biomarkers and gut microbiota analysis, we reveal the mechanisms of adaptation to high altitudes in plateau pika.","[Chen, Xi; Wang, Zaiwei; LI, Huan; Fu, Keyi; Wang, Zilong; Yuan, Xuefeng; Shi, Ziyue; Miao, Xiumei; Yang, Mei; Yang, Yunfeng; Shi, Zunji] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Ctr Grassland Microbiome, State Key Lab Herbage Improvement & Grassland Agro, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Su, Junhu] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Sci, Key Lab Grassland Ecosyst, Minist Educ, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Jinbo] Ningbo Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yunfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Cont, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zunji] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Gansu Agricultural University; Ningbo University; Tsinghua University; Lanzhou University,"Shi, ZJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",shizj@lzu.edu.cn,,,Leading Scientist Project of Qinghai Province [2023-NK-147]; Foundation of Science and Technology of Gansu Province [22JR5RA457]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2022-ct04]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32061123004]; Open Fund Project of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Genetic Diseases [GXWCH-ZDKF-2022-15]; Open Fund Project of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health and Birth Defect Prevention [GXWCH-ZDKF-2022-09]; Foundation of Guangxi Health Commission [S2021068],Leading Scientist Project of Qinghai Province; Foundation of Science and Technology of Gansu Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Fund Project of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Genetic Diseases; Open Fund Project of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health and Birth Defect Prevention; Foundation of Guangxi Health Commission,"The authors are very grateful for the valuable comments on manuscript revisions of the editor.

Peptides encoded by the genes of the highly polymorphic Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) form the first line of host defence against pathogens. Aside from direct involvement in mounting adaptive immune responses, MHC class II genes are hypothesized to regulate gut commensal diversity and shape the production of immune-modulatory substances by microbes, indirectly affecting host susceptibility. Despite initial empirical evidence for the link between host MHC and the microbiota, associations among these factors remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we examined MHC allelic diversity and constitution, the gut bacterial community and abundance pattern of a wild population of a neotropical bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) challenged by AstV infections. First, we show an age-dependent relationship between the host MHC class II diversity and constitution and the gut microbiota in AstV-uninfected bats. Crucially, these associations changed in AstV-infected bats. Additionally, we identify changes in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa linked to the presence of certain MHC supertypes and AstV infection. We suggest changes in the microbiota to be either a result of AstV infection or the MHC-mediated modulation of microbial communities. The latter could subsequently affect microbe-mediated immunity and resistance against AstV infection. Our results emphasize that the reciprocal nature of host immune genetics, gut microbial diversity and pathogen infection require attention, which are particularly important given their repercussions for disease susceptibility and severity in wild animal populations with a history of zoonotic spillover and frequent human contact.","[Fleischer, Ramona; Schmid, Dominik W.; Braendel, Stefan D.; Tschapka, Marco; Sommer, Simone] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany; [Wasimuddin] CSIR Ctr Cellular & Mol Biol, Hyderabad, India; [Braendel, Stefan D.; Rasche, Andrea; Tschapka, Marco] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ancon, Panama; [Rasche, Andrea; Corman, Victor M.; Drosten, Christian] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Virol, Berlin, Germany; [Rasche, Andrea; Corman, Victor M.; Drosten, Christian] Free Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Rasche, Andrea; Corman, Victor M.; Drosten, Christian] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Rasche, Andrea; Corman, Victor M.; Drosten, Christian] Berlin Inst Hlth, Berlin, Germany; [Corman, Victor M.; Drosten, Christian] Associated Partner Charite, German Ctr Infect Res DZIF, Berlin, Germany",Ulm University; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB); Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; German Center for Infection Research,"Fleischer, R; Sommer, S (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany.",ramona.fleischer@uni-ulm.de; simone.sommer@uni-ulm.de,"Corman, Victor M/K-1319-2019; Schmid, Dominik/HCI-3193-2022; Schmid, Dominik W./U-2475-2019; , Wasimuddin/N-9486-2014","Corman, Victor M/0000-0002-3605-0136; Schmid, Dominik W./0000-0001-8908-3882; , Wasimuddin/0000-0002-8314-8160; Fleischer, Ramona/0000-0003-1657-9347","German Science Foundation (DFG) [SO 428/9-1, SO 428/9-2, TS 81/7-1, TS 81/7-2, DR 772/8-1]",German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"German Science Foundation (DFG), Grant/Award Number: SO 428/9-1, SO 428/9-2, TS 81/7-1, TS 81/7-2 and DR 772/8-1",,140,8,8,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We knew that shifts in animal dietary habits lead to changes in the structure of the gut microbiota, but we are not sure about if changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota respond to changes in the nutrient intake or food items. To investigate how animal feeding strategies affect nutrient intakes and thus alter the composition and digestion function of gut microbiota, we selected a group of wild primate group for the study. We quantified their diet and macronutrients intake in four seasons of a year, and instant fecal samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and metagenomics. These results demonstrated that the main reason that causes seasonal shifts of gut microbiota is the macronutrient variation induced by seasonal dietary differences. Gut microbes can help to compensate for insufficient macronutrients intake of the host through microbial metabolic functions. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the causes of seasonal variation in host-microbial variation in wild primates.","[Li, Yuhang; Yan, Yujie; Fu, Hengguang; Jin, Shiyu; He, Shujun; Wang, Zi; Li, Baoguo; Guo, Songtao] Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shaanxi Key Lab Anim Conservat, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Dong, Guixin] Guangdong Chimelong Grp Co Ltd, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Dong, Guixin] Guangdong South China Rare Wild Anim Species Conse, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Baoguo] Shaanxi Inst Zool, Xian, Peoples R China; [Guo, Songtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Guo, ST (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shaanxi Key Lab Anim Conservat, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Guo, ST (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",songtaoguo@nwu.edu.cn,,,Major International Joint Research Program of Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32220103002]; NSFC [31872247]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 31020302]; Qinghai Province High-level Innovative Thousand Talents Program,Major International Joint Research Program of Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Qinghai Province High-level Innovative Thousand Talents Program,"This project was sponsored by the Major International Joint Research Program of Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (32220103002), research programs of NSFC (31872247), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB 31020302), and the Qinghai Province High-level Innovative Thousand Talents Program.",,70,0,0,11,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

To date, few longitudinal studies have investigated the causes and consequences of microbiota variation in wildlife, although such studies provide a comparative context for interpreting the adaptive significance of findings from studies on humans or captive animals. Here, we investigate the impact of seasonality, diet, group membership, sex, age, and reproductive state on gut microbiota composition in a wild population of group-living, frugi-folivorous primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). We repeatedly sampled 32 individually recognizable animals from eight adjacent groups over the course of two different climatic seasons. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the microbiota composition of 187 fecal samples. We demonstrate a clear pattern of seasonal variation in the intestinal microbiota, especially affecting the Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio, which may be driven by seasonal differences in diet. The relative abundances of certain polysaccharide-fermenting taxa, for example, Lachnospiraceae, were correlated with fruit and fiber consumption. Additionally, group membership influenced microbiota composition independent of season, but further studies are needed to determine whether this pattern is driven by group divergences in diet, social contacts, or genetic factors. In accordance with findings in other wild mammals and primates with seasonally fluctuating food availability, we demonstrate seasonal variation in the microbiota of wild Verreaux's sifakas, which may be driven by food availability. This study adds to mounting evidence that variation in the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the ability of primates to cope with seasonal variation in food availability.","[Springer, Andrea; Fichtel, Claudia; Koch, Flavia; Kappeler, Peter M.] German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany; [Springer, Andrea] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Ctr Infect Med, Inst Parasitol, Hannover, Germany; [Al-Ghalith, Gabriel A.] Univ Minnesota, Biomed Informat & Computat Biol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Koch, Flavia] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Psychol, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Vet & Biomed Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] GreenViet Biodivers Conservat Ctr, Son Tra Dist, Danang, Vietnam; [Knights, Dan] Univ Minnesota, Inst Biotechnol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Knights, Dan] Univ Minnesota, Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Kappeler, Peter M.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany",Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ); University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Lethbridge; Northwestern University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Gottingen,"Springer, A (corresponding author), German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany.;Springer, A (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Ctr Infect Med, Inst Parasitol, Hannover, Germany.",andrea.springer@tiho-hannover.de,"Kappeler, Peter M/B-6825-2012","Clayton, Jonathan/0000-0003-3709-3362",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Ka1082/29-1]; National Institutes of Health [NIH/NIDA T32 DA007097-32],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/ Award Number: Ka1082/29-1; National Institutes of Health, Grant/ Award Number: NIH/NIDA T32 DA007097-32",,72,63,63,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Tibetan wild asses (TWA, Equus kiang) are the only wild perissodactyls on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and the first national protected animals; however, knowledge about the relationships between their gut microbiota and the host's adaptability remains poorly understood. Herein, 16S rRNA and meta-genomic sequencing approaches were employed to investigate the gut microbiota-host associations in TWA and were compared against those of the co-resident livestock of yak (Bos grunnies) and Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries). Results revealed that the gut microbiota of yak and Tibetan sheep underwent convergent evolution. By contrast, the intestinal microflora of TWA diverged in a direction enabling the host to subsist on sparse and low-quality forage. Meanwhile, high microbial diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices), cellulolytic activity, and abundant indicator species such as Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Prevotella_1, and Treponema_2 supported forage digestion and short-chain fatty acid production in the gut of TWA. Meanwhile, the enterotype identification analysis showed that TWA shifted their enterotype in response to low-quality forage for a better utilization of forage nitrogen and short-chain fatty acid production. Metagenomic analysis revealed that plant biomass degrading microbial consortia, genes, and enzymes like the cellulolytic strains (Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Ruminobacter amylophilus), as well as carbohydrate metabolism genes (GH43, GH3, GH31, GH5, and GH10) and enzymes (beta-glucosidase, xylanase, and beta-xylosidase, etc.) had a significantly higher enrichment in TWA. Our results indicate that gut microbiota can improve the adaptability of TWA through plant biomass degradation and energy maintenance by the functions of gut microbiota in the face of nutritional deficiencies and also provide a strong rationale for understanding the roles of gut microbiota in the adaptation of QTP wildlife when facing harsh feeding environments.","[Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Na; Hu, Linyong; Wang, Xungang; Luo, Chongliang; Zhao, Xinquan; Xu, Shixiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Na; Hu, Linyong; Wang, Xungang; Luo, Chongliang; Zhao, Xinquan; Xu, Shixiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sanjiangyuan Natl Pk, Xining, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Na; Hu, Linyong; Wang, Xungang; Luo, Chongliang; Zhao, Xinquan; Xu, Shixiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Peoples R China; [Han, Xueping; Chen, Yongwei] Technol Extens Serv Anim Husb Qinghai, Xining, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xinquan] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Qinghai University,"Zhao, XQ; Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Peoples R China.;Zhao, XQ; Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sanjiangyuan Natl Pk, Xining, Peoples R China.;Zhao, XQ; Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Peoples R China.;Zhao, XQ (corresponding author), Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining, Peoples R China.",xqzhao@nwipb.cas.cn; sxxu@nwipb.cas.cn,"Liu, Hongjin/GRE-8828-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [32100100]; Fundamental Research Project of Qinghai Province [2022-ZJ-943Q]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFD1600200]; Second Comprehensive Scientific Investigation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [2019QZKK040104],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Project of Qinghai Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Second Comprehensive Scientific Investigation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,"Funding This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 32100100), Fundamental Research Project of Qinghai Province (2022-ZJ-943Q), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD1600200), and the Second Comprehensive Scientific Investigation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2019QZKK040104).",,78,0,0,13,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

An essential mechanism to adapt to environmental and social changes is the fluctuations in the host gut microbiome. Here we give a comprehensive description of anthropogenically induced microbiome alterations in Asian elephants (n=30). We detected gut microbial changes due to overseas translocation, captivity and deworming. We found that microbes belonging to Planococcaceae had the highest contribution in the microbiome alterations after translocation, while Clostridiaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Bacteroidia were the most affected after captivity. However, deworming significantly changed the abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Weeksellaceae and Burkholderiaceae. These findings may provide fundamental ideas to help guide the preservation tactics and probiotic replacement therapies of a dysbiosed gut microbiome in Asian elephants.

The gut microbial characteristics were examined in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) from eastern China (Huangshan, Anhui), but little is known about other geographical populations. Herein, we collected 40 fecal samples of Tibetan macaques from the Labahe Natural Reserve in western China over four seasons and analyzed the seasonal variation of gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 sequencing. The analysis showed that gut microbial diversity and composition varied by season. Autumn exhibited the lowest alpha diversity and remarkably separated from the other three seasons for beta diversity. There were statistically significant differences in the composition of gut microbiota during different seasons. Autumn presented the lowest Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio while winter had the highest. The family Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae within Firmicutes accounted for a high proportion in each season, but the abundance of Lactobacillaceae was significantly lower in winter. During autumn, Preotella, which can utilize carbohydrates increased significantly. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) prediction revealed that metabolism of cofactors of vitamin pathways and glycan biosynthesis pathways were highly enriched in autumn. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota potentially play an important role in the adaptation of wild Tibetan macaques to the seasonal fluctuations of food availability, which may contribute to the conservation of this endangered species.

In this study, we explored the gut microbiota of the endangered white-headed black langur (Trachypithecus leucocephalus), which is endemic to the limestone forests of Southwest Guangxi, China, to understand its adaptation strategies to seasonal changes in habitat using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results revealed significant seasonal variations in the gut microbiota of white-headed black langurs. In particular, the alpha diversity was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, and the beta diversity was significantly different between the two seasons. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Proteobacteria was higher in the dry season than that in the rainy season, whereas that of Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetota, and Cyanobacteria was significantly higher in the rainy season than that in the dry season. At the family level, Oscillospiraceae and Eggerthellaceae were more abundant in the dry season than in the rainy season, whereas Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Monoglobaceae were more abundant in the rainy season than in the dry season. These results could have been obtained due to seasonal changes in the diet of langurs in response to food plant phenology. In addition, the neutral community model revealed that the gut microbiota assembly of these langurs was dominated by deterministic processes and was more significantly affected by ecological factors in the dry season than in the rainy season, which could be linked to the higher dependence of these langurs on mature leaves in the dry season. We concluded that the seasonal variations in the gut microbiota of white-headed black langurs occurred in response to food plant phenology in their habitat, highlighting the importance of microbiota in responding to fluctuating ecological factors and adapting to seasonal dietary changes.","[Chen, Yanqiong; Lai, Ying; Zheng, Jingjin; Liu, Zheng; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Minist Educ, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yanqiong; Lai, Ying; Zheng, Jingjin; Liu, Zheng; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yanqiong; Lai, Ying; Zheng, Jingjin; Liu, Zheng; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Nong, Dengpan; Liang, Jipeng] Adm Ctr Guangxi Chongzuo White headed Langur Natl, Chongzuo, Peoples R China",Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Normal University; Guangxi Normal University,"Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Minist Educ, Guilin, Peoples R China.;Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, Guilin, Peoples R China.;Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guilin, Peoples R China.",hzh773@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [32170488, 31960106, 31960104]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32170488, 31960106, and 31960104).",,91,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Conversely, whether and how inherently disturbed canonical Th1 (pro-inflammatory) and/or Th2 (anti-inflammatory) immune pathways modify the host microbiome is not sufficiently investigated. Here, we characterized the humoral, cellular, and cytokine immunity, and associated alterations in gut microbiota of naive wild-type mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c), and mice with deficiencies in Th2 responses (IL-4R alpha and IL-33 knockout mice) or in both Th1 and Th2 responses (NOD scid gamma, NSG mice). A global analysis by de novo clustering of 16S rRNA profiles of the gut microbiota independently grouped wild-type immunocompetent (C57BL/6 and BALB/c), Th2-deficient (IL-4R alpha(-/-) and IL-33(-/-)), and severely immunodeficient (NSG) mice; where wild-type mice, but not Th2 or severely immunodeficient mice, were enriched in gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These include members of phyla Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes such as Lactobacillus spp., Akkermansia muciniphila, and Odoribacter spp. Further comparison of the two naive wild-type mouse strains showed higher microbial diversity (Shannon), primarily linked to higher richness (Chao1), as well as a distinct difference in microbial composition (weighted UniFrac) in BALB/c mice compared to C57BL/6. T-cell and blood cytokine analyses demonstrated a Th1-polarization in naive adaptive immunity in C57BL/6 animals compared to BALB/c mice, and an expected Th2 deficient cellular response in IL-4R alpha(-/-) and IL-33(-/-) mice compared to its genetic background BALB/c strain. Together, these data suggest that alterations in the Th1/Th2 balance or a complete ablation of Th1/Th2 responses can lead to major alterations in gut microbiota composition and function. Given the similarities between the human and mouse immune systems and gut microbiota, our finding that immune status is a strong driver of gut microbiota composition has important consequences for human immunodeficiency studies.","[Van Averbeke, Vincent; Berkell, Matilda; De Winter, Fien H.

High-altitude environments are one of the extreme environments for animals, especially in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, driving the inquiry of whether, under broader phylogeny, high-altitude factors drive the convergent evolution of Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla gut microbiomes. Therefore, we profiled the gut microbiome of Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla at high and low altitudes using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. According to cluster analyses, the gut microbiome compositions of high-altitude Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla were not grouped together and were far from those of low-altitude Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla. The Wilcoxon's test in high-altitude ungulates showed significantly higher Sobs and Shannon indices than in low-altitude ungulates. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Patescibacteria were significantly enriched in the gut microbiomes of high-altitude ungulates, which also displayed a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes value than low-altitude ungulates. At the family level, Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, and Saccharimonadaceae were significantly enriched in the gut microbiomes of high-altitude ungulates. Our results also indicated that the OH and FH groups shared two significantly enriched genera, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group and Candidatus_Saccharimonas. These findings indicated that a high altitude cannot surpass the order level to drive the convergent evolution of ungulate gut microbiome composition but can drive the convergent evolution of alpha diversity and indicator microbiota in the gut microbiome of ungulates.

However, it remains unclear whether the disruption to wildlife gut microbiomes is caused by habitat fragmentation per se or the combination of habitat fragmentation with additional anthropogenic disturbances, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and their pathogens. Here, we show that habitat fragmentation per se does not impact the gut microbiome of a generalist rodent species native to Central America, Tome's spiny rat Proechimys semispinosus, but additional anthropogenic disturbances do. Indeed, compared to protected continuous and fragmented forest landscapes that are largely untouched by other human activities, the gut microbiomes of spiny rats inhabiting human-disturbed fragmented landscapes revealed a reduced alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed beta diversity. Their microbiomes contained more taxa associated with domesticated animals and their potential pathogens, suggesting a shift in potential metagenome functions. On the one hand, the compositional shift could indicate a degree of gut microbial adaption known as metagenomic plasticity. On the other hand, the greater variation in community structure and reduced alpha diversity may signal a decline in beneficial microbial functions and illustrate that gut adaption may not catch up with anthropogenic disturbances, even in a generalist species with large phenotypic plasticity, with potentially harmful consequences to both wildlife and human health. Fackelmann et al. study the gut microbial composition of spiny rats across tropical forests in Panama with varying levels of protection and fragmentation in order to disentangle the relative influences of habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife gut microbiomes. They find that habitat fragmentation on its own did not affect the gut microbiome, but the microbiomes of individuals inhabiting forest fragments affected by anthropogenic disturbance displayed a shift in community composition and structure, and were more likely to have microbiota associated with domesticated animals and their pathogens.","[Fackelmann, Gloria; Gillingham, Mark A.

Gut microbiome is an important determinant of animal health and population survival as it affects the adaptation of the animals to different foods and environments under kinetic changes of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate gut fecal microbiome profiles of snub-nosed monkeys affected by several extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including raising patterns (captive vs. wild), age, sex, and diarrheal status to provide a reference for making protection strategies.ResultsThe 16S rRNA gene sequencing was firstly used to pre-check clustering of 38 fecal samples from the monkeys including 30 wild and 8 captive (5 healthy and 3 diarrheal) from three Regions of Shennongjia Nature Reserve, Hubei Province, China. Then the 24 samples with high-quality DNA from 18 wild and 6 captive (4 healthy and 2 diarrheal) monkeys were subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize bacterial gut microbial communities. We discovered that the raising pattern (captive and wild) rather than age and sex was the predominant factor attributed to gut microbiome structure and proportionality. Wild monkeys had significantly higher bacterial diversity and lower Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratios than captive animals. Moreover, the gut microbiomes in wild healthy monkeys were enriched for the genes involved in fatty acid production, while in captive animals, genes were enriched for vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis from carbohydrate intermediates. Additionally, a total of 37 antibiotic resistant genes (ARG) types were detected. Unlike the microbiome diversity, the captive monkeys have a higher diversity of ARG than the wild animals.ConclusionTaken together, we highlight the importance of self-reprogramed metabolism in the snub-nosed monkey gut microbiome to help captive and wild monkeys adapt to different intrinsic and extrinsic environmental change.","[Zhao, Gang; Qi, Mingpu; Wang, Qiankun; Chen, Yingyu; Chen, Huanchun; Guo, Aizhen] State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Gang; Qi, Mingpu; Wang, Qiankun; Hu, Changmin; Chen, Yingyu; Chen, Huanchun; Guo, Aizhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Gang; Chen, Yingyu; Chen, Huanchun; Guo, Aizhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Cooperat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Pig Prod, Hubei Hongshan Lab, Hubei Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Vet Epidemio, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Gang; Li, Xiang; Chen, Yingyu; Chen, Huanchun; Guo, Aizhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Shennongjia Sci & Technol Innovat Ctr, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Gang; Chen, Yingyu; Chen, Huanchun; Guo, Aizhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Profess Lab Anim TB Wuhan, Key Lab Dev Vet Diagnost Prod, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jingyuan; Yu, Huiliang] Hubei Key Lab Conservat Biol Shennongjia Golden Mo, Shennongjia Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Shennongjia 442411, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Guo, AZ (corresponding author), State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Guo, AZ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Guo, AZ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Cooperat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Pig Prod, Hubei Hongshan Lab, Hubei Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Vet Epidemio, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Guo, AZ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Shennongjia Sci & Technol Innovat Ctr, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Guo, AZ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Profess Lab Anim TB Wuhan, Key Lab Dev Vet Diagnost Prod, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",aizhen@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Wang, Yu/AAE-7736-2022","Wang, Yu/0000-0002-6296-6965; Li, Xiang/0000-0002-9168-1598; Qi, Mingpu/0000-0003-3390-0024",Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2021CFB118]; National Science and Technology Infrastructure Program of China [2013BAD03B01-01],Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); National Science and Technology Infrastructure Program of China,This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2021CFB118) and National Science and Technology Infrastructure Program of China (#2013BAD03B01-01).,,65,1,1,7,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2164,,,BMC GENOMICS,BMC Genomics,FEB 3,2023,24,1,,,,,,,62,10.1186/s12864-023-09142-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-023-09142-6,,,15,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,8P0NR,36737703,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000926228400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We found significantly different diversities and compositions of gut microbiota among both groups associated with different living environments. Heterogeneous selection was the predominant factor regulating the gut microbiota community under similar climatic conditions, indicating that microbial community assembly was largely driven by deterministic mechanisms. The species co-occurrence network showed complex and tight connections with a higher positive correlation in the wild environment. Moreover, the captive group exhibited significant differences in chemoheterotrophy and fermentation compared with the wild group, but the opposite was observed in animal parasites or symbionts, which might be closely related to diet, energy supply, and healthcare of animals.

Our group has recently revealed that the occurrence of diverse combinations of gut microbial compositions and functions (metagenomics) in Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) populations is likely to lead to increased evolutionary potential and resilience in response to environmental changes. Thus, considering the effects of diet on the gut microbiome and the importance of a stable gut microbial community to host health, we suggest that a transitional buffer period (with feeding on a regular diet and a diet from the translocation habitat) is needed before animal translocation. When the gut microbiome enters into relatively stable stages and adapts to the new diet from the translocation site, the time is suitable for translocation. Long-term monitoring of the gut microbiomes of translocated animals (by collecting fresh feces and carrying out next-generation sequencing) is still necessary after their translocation.","[Yao, Ran; Xu, Lianglaing; Zhu, Lifeng] Nanjing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Guoqing] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE USA",Nanjing Normal University; University of Nebraska System,"Zhu, LF (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhulf@ioz.ac.cn,"Zhu, Lifeng/AAK-8892-2020; Zhu, Lifeng/AEY-7193-2022","Zhu, Lifeng/0000-0002-0589-4256","National Natural Science Fund [31222009, 31570489]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",National Natural Science Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Fund (31222009, 31570489) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,15,3,3,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1176-9343,,,EVOL BIOINFORM,Evol.

Our findings indicate complex effects of a germ-free status on myelin-related characteristics, and highlight the adaptive properties of myelination as a result of environmental manipulation.","[Radulescu, Carola I.; Garcia-Miralles, Marta; Sidik, Harwin; Bardile, Costanza Ferrari; Yusof, Nur Amirah Binte Mohammad; Pouladi, Mahmoud A.] ASTAR, TLGM, 8A Biomed Grove,Level 5, Singapore 138648, Singapore; [Radulescu, Carola I.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Sheffield S1 2LT, S Yorkshire, England; [Lee, Hae Ung; Pettersson, Sven] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Ho, Eliza Xin Pei; Chu, Collins Wenhan; Layton, Emma; De Sessions, Paola Florez] ASTAR, Genome Inst Singapore, GIS Efficient Rapid Microbial Sequencing, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Low, Donovan; Ginhoux, Florent] ASTAR, Singapore Immunol Network, Singapore 138648, Singapore; [Pettersson, Sven] Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, 60 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Pouladi, Mahmoud A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Med, Singapore 117597, Singapore; [Pouladi, Mahmoud A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Physiol, Singapore 117597, Singapore; [Radulescu, Carola I.] Imperial Coll London, UK Dementia Res Inst, London W12 0NN, England",Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS); Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN); Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Imperial College London,"Pouladi, MA (corresponding author), ASTAR, TLGM, 8A Biomed Grove,Level 5, Singapore 138648, Singapore.",map@pouladilab.org,"Pouladi, Mahmoud A/B-8743-2016","Pouladi, Mahmoud A/0000-0002-9030-0976; Yusof, Amirah/0000-0002-0490-7617",Agency for Science Technology and Research; National University of Singapore; LKC School of Medicine; SCELSE,Agency for Science Technology and Research(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore); LKC School of Medicine; SCELSE,"We thank members of the Pouladi lab for thoughtful discussions and comments.

These studies demonstrate numerous connections between the gut microbiome and vital host functions, primarily in humans, model organisms, and domestic animals. As the adaptive importance of the gut microbiome becomes clearer, interest in studying the gut microbiomes of wild populations has increased, in part due to the potential for discovering conservation applications. The study of wildlife gut microbiomes holds many new challenges and opportunities due to the complex genetic, spatial, and environmental structure of wild host populations, and the potential for these factors to interact with the microbiome. The emerging picture of adaptive coevolution in host-microbiome relationships highlights the importance of understanding microbiome variation in the context of host population genetics and landscape heterogeneity across a wide range of host populations. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding wildlife gut microbiomes in relation to landscape variables and host population genetics, including the potential of approaches derived from landscape genetics. We use this framework to review current research, synthesize important trends, highlight implications for conservation, and recommend future directions for research. Specifically, we focus on how spatial structure and environmental variation interact with host population genetics and microbiome variation in natural populations, and what we can learn from how these patterns of covariation differ depending on host ecological and evolutionary traits.","[Couch, Claire E.; Epps, Clinton W.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Couch, CE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",claire.couch@oregonstate.edu,,,"American Genetic Association Evolutionary, Ecological, and Conservation Genomics Award","American Genetic Association Evolutionary, Ecological, and Conservation Genomics Award","Funding from the American Genetic Association Evolutionary, Ecological, and Conservation Genomics Award supported Dr. Couch's previous work that was instrumental in the conceptualization of this work.",,131,4,4,7,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-1503,1465-7333,,J HERED,J.

Changes in food and environment are major divergences in the domestication of dogs. Gut microbes play an important role in animal adaptation to the food and environmental changes. In this study, shotgun sequencing was performed to compare the species diversity and functional diversity of gut microbes in wild wolves (group CLW, n = 3), captive wolves (group CLC, n = 4), and domestic dogs (group CLF, n = 4). The results found that Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla and Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Megamonas, Paraprevotella, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium were the most abundant genera in the gut of wolves and dogs. Groups CLW, CLC and CLF have shown significant difference in gut microbial species diversity and functional diversity. Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Faecalibacterium were most abundant genera in groups CLW, CLC and CLF, respectively. Their abundance varied significantly among groups. Compared to the wild wolves, the intestinal microbiol genes of domestic dogs were significantly enriched in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway of KEGG database. One hundred and seventy-seven enzymes were detected with significantly higher abundance in group CLF than that in group CLW, and 49 enzymes showed extremely significant higher abundance in group CLF than that in group CLW (q < 0.01) base on the function abundance annotated in CAZy database. It is noteworthy that there were also significant differences in the abundance of 140 enzymes between groups CLC and CLW (q < 0.05). Clustering analysis based on both the species and the function abundance of intestinal microbiota all found that groups CLC and CLF clustered into one branch, while samples from group CLW clustered into the other branch. This result suggests that captive wolves are more similar to domestic dogs than wild wolves in both species composition and function composition of intestinal microbiota.","[Chen, Lei; Sun, Mengyao; Xu, Di; Gao, Zenghao; Shi, Yuying; Wang, Shen; Zhou, Yiping] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University,"Chen, L (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu, Peoples R China.",leisurechen@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [31400473],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ,This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31400473).,,33,0,0,9,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Conventional techniques of fecal microbiome analysis have been developed within the broad contexts defined by human biology; hence, many of these techniques are not immediately applicable to wild nonhuman primates. In order to establish a standard experimental protocol for the analysis of the gut microbiomes of wild animals, we selected the Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui) on Yakushima Island. We tested different protocols for each stage of fecal sample processing: storage, DNA extraction, and choice of the sequencing region in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We also analyzed the gut microbiome of captive Japanese macaques as the control. The comparison of samples obtained from identical macaques but subjected to different protocols showed that the tested storage methods (RNAlater and lysis buffer) produced effectively the same composition of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as the standard frozen storage method, although the relative abundance of each OTU was quantitatively affected. Taxonomic assignment of the detected bacterial groups was also significantly affected by the region being sequenced, indicating that sequencing regions and the corresponding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer pairs for the 16S rRNA gene should be carefully selected. This study improves the current standard methods for microbiome analysis in wild nonhuman primates. Japanese macaques were shown to be a suitable model for understanding microbiome adaptation to various environments.","[Hayakawa, Takashi] Kyoto Univ, Nagoya Railrd Co Ltd, Primate Res Inst, Dept Wildlife Sci, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Hayakawa, Takashi] Japan Monkey Ctr, Inuyama, Aichi 4840081, Japan; [Sawada, Akiko] Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sakyo Ku, 1-5 Hangi Cho, Kyoto 6068522, Japan; [Sawada, Akiko; Kurihara, Yosuke] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Chiyoda Ku, Kojimachi Business Ctr Bldg,5-3-1 Kojimachi, Tokyo 1020083, Japan; [Tanabe, Akifumi S.] Ryukoku Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Solut Technol, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, 246-2 Mizukami, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji] Kanagawa Inst Ind Sci & Technol, Intestinal Microbiota Project, Kawasaki Ku, 3-25-13 Tonomachi, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2100821, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji] Univ Tsukuba, Transborder Med Res Ctr, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kishida, Takushi; Matsushima, Kei; Liu, Jie; Suzumura, Takafumi; Sugiura, Hideki; Agata, Kiyokazu] Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, 2-24 Tanaka Sekiden Cho, Kyoto 6068203, Japan; [Kurihara, Yosuke; Hanya, Goro] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Ecol & Conservat Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Akomo-Okoue, Etienne-Francois] Res Inst Trop Ecol IRET CENAREST, Post Box 13354, Libreville, Gabon; [Gravena, Waleska] Natl Inst Amazonian Res, Aquat Mammals Lab, BR-69011970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Gravena, Waleska] Amazonas Fed Univ, Hlth & Biotechnol Inst, BR-69460000 Coari, Brazil; [Kashima, Makoto] Ryukoku Univ, Res Inst Food & Agr, 1-5 Yokotani, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan; [Suzuki, Mariko] Kagoshima Univ, Int Ctr Isl Studies, Amami Stn, 2-1 Naze Yanagimachi, Kagoshima 8940032, Japan; [Kadowaki, Kohmei] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Promot Interdisciplinary Educ & Res, Educ & Res Unit Studies Connect Hills Humans & Oc, Sakyi Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Inoue, Eiji] Toho Univ, Fac Sci, 2-2-1 Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba 2748510, Japan; [Agata, Kiyokazu] Gakushuin Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Grad Course Life Sci, Dept Life Sci,Fac Sci, Mejiro1-5-1, Tokyo 1718588, Japan",Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Kyoto Prefectural University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ryukoku University; Keio University; Kanagawa Academy Science & Technology; University of Tsukuba; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Ryukoku University; Kagoshima University; Kyoto University; Toho University; Gakushuin University,"Hayakawa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Nagoya Railrd Co Ltd, Primate Res Inst, Dept Wildlife Sci, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan.;Hayakawa, T (corresponding author), Japan Monkey Ctr, Inuyama, Aichi 4840081, Japan.",hayak.tak@gmail.com,"Liu, Jie/ABE-6862-2020; Kishida, Takushi/H-3381-2012; Gravena, Waleska/AAJ-2875-2020; Kadowaki, Kohmei/K-8117-2019; Hayakawa, Takashi/U-9518-2018; Tanabe, Akifumi/P-9381-2015","Kishida, Takushi/0000-0002-2220-7892; Gravena, Waleska/0000-0002-1102-971X; Kadowaki, Kohmei/0000-0003-0512-1621; Hayakawa, Takashi/0000-0002-1037-0350; Agata, Kiyokazu/0000-0002-5195-2576; Kurihara, Yosuke/0000-0002-1191-2190; Fukuda, Shinji/0000-0001-5161-9880; Tanabe, Akifumi/0000-0003-1017-6504","Leading Graduate Program of Primatology and Wildlife Science (PWS) of Kyoto University; MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [12J04270, 16K18630, 17H01911, 25840170, 25291100]; Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research [15KK0256]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25840170, 17H01911, 16K18630] Funding Source: KAKEN","Leading Graduate Program of Primatology and Wildlife Science (PWS) of Kyoto University; MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank our friends and colleagues in Yakushima.

We studied the effects of two feeding systems on the rumen and hindgut microbiome of semi-feral Tibetan goats kept at high altitude (similar to 4800 m) using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. Intensive drylot feeding resulted in significantly higher zootechnical performance, narrower ruminal acetate: propionate ratios and a drop in the average rumen pH at slaughter to similar to 5.04. Hindgut microbial adaption appeared to be more diverse in the drylot group suggesting a higher influx of undegraded complex non-starch polysaccharides from the rumen. Despite their higher fiber levels in the diet, grazing goats exhibited lower counts of Methanobrevibacter and genes associated with the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway, presumably reflecting the scarce dietary conditions (low energy density) when rearing goats on pasture from extreme alpine environments. These conditions appeared to promote a relevant abundance of bacitracin genes. In parallel, we recognized a significant increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the digestive tracts of drylot animals. In summary, this study provides a deeper insight into the metataxonomic and functional adaption of the gastrointestinal microbiome of goats subject to intensive drylot and extensive pasture rearing conditions at high altitude.","[Zhang, Ke; Xu, Yangbin; Zhang, Chenguang; Li, Chao; Yang, Yuxin; Kalds, Peter; Wang, Xiaolong; Chen, Yulin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Key Lab Anim Genet Breeding & Reprod Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Chong; Jing, Xu; Wang, Meili] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Suo, Langda; Wu, Yujiang] Tibet Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci, Inst Anim Sci, Lhasa 850009, Peoples R China; [Song, Jiuzhou] Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Brugger, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Vet Fac, Inst Anim Nutr, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Tibet Academy of Agriculture & Animal Husbandry Sciences; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Zurich,"Chen, YL (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Xinong Rd 22, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",chenyulin@nwafu.edu.cn,"Brugger, Daniel/E-6905-2018; yujiang, wu/ABI-3228-2020","Brugger, Daniel/0000-0001-7267-0335; Zhang, Ke/0000-0002-2392-1545; Chen, Yulin/0000-0001-5679-4055; Kalds, Peter/0000-0002-4276-483X","Tibet Science and Technology Department's '13th Five-Year Plan' Major Agriculture Project [XZ201901NA02, 2017NY-072, 2018KJXX-009]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS-3-12]; Key Research and Development Programof Shaanxi [2019ZDLNY07-02-01]",Tibet Science and Technology Department's '13th Five-Year Plan' Major Agriculture Project; China Agriculture Research System; Key Research and Development Programof Shaanxi,"The present study was supported by the Tibet Science and Technology Department's '13th Five-Year Plan' Major Agriculture Project (XZ201901NA02), the Local Grants (2017NY-072 and 2018KJXX-009), as well as by China Agriculture Research System (CARS-3-12), Key Research and Development Programof Shaanxi (Number 2019ZDLNY07-02-01).

Therefore, understanding the gut microbiota composition and function of wild asses can provide a theoretical for the situ conservation of wild animals in the future.In this study, we measured the dry matter digestion by the 4 molar hydrochloric acid (4N HCL) acid-insoluble ash method and analyzed the intestinal microbiota of wild asses and domestic donkeys by high-throughput sequencing of the 16s rDNA genes in V3-V4 regions. The results showed that the dry matter digestion in wild asses was significantly higher than in domestic donkeys (P < 0.05). No significant difference in alpha diversity was detected between these two groups. Beta diversity showed that the bacterial community structure of wild asses was acutely different from domestic donkeys. At the phylum level, the two dominant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in wild asses were significantly higher than that in domestic donkeys. At the genus level, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, Phascolarctobacterium, Coprostanoligenes_group, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group and Akkermansia in wild asses were significantly higher than in domestic donkeys. Moreover, statistical comparisons showed that 40 different metabolic pathways exhibited significant differences. Among them, 29 pathways had richer concentrations in wild asses than domestic donkeys, mainly included amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism. Of note, network analysis showed that wild asses harbored a relatively more complex bacterial network than domestic donkeys, possibly reflecting the specific niche adaption of gut bacterial communities through species interactions. The overall results indicated that wild asses have advantages over domestic donkeys in dry matter digestion, gut microbial community composition and function, and wild asses have their unique intestinal flora to adapt high altitudes on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.","[Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Xinquan; Han, Xueping; Xu, Shixiao; Zhao, Liang; Hu, Linyong; Xu, Tianwei; Zhao, Na; Zhang, Xiaoling; Chen, Dongdong; He, Fuquan; Chen, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Xinquan; Han, Xueping; Xu, Shixiao; Zhao, Liang; Hu, Linyong; Xu, Tianwei; Zhao, Na; Zhang, Xiaoling; Chen, Dongdong; He, Fuquan; Chen, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongjin; Han, Xueping; Zhang, Xiaoling; Chen, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.;Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",sxxu@nwipb.cas.cn,"Liu, Hongjin/GRE-8828-2022; Xu, Tianwei/AAS-3412-2020","Xu, Tianwei/0000-0003-4048-4743; Liu, Hongjin/0000-0001-5625-2395",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFD0502301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31402120]; Key R&D and transformation plan of Qinghai Province [2019-SF-153]; The Dawn of West China 2018 Talent Training Program of CAS,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key R&D and transformation plan of Qinghai Province; The Dawn of West China 2018 Talent Training Program of CAS,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFD0502301), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31402120), the Key R&D and transformation plan of Qinghai Province (No. 2019-SF-153), and The Dawn of West China 2018 Talent Training Program of CAS by Dongdong Chen.

However, the wild population became extinct in China around 1900. In 1986, 39 Pere David's deer were reintroduced into Dafeng. Up until now, its wild population has reached 2658, with a total of 6119 in 2021. At present, due to the continuous increase in the population, the repeated grazing on the same plants by the Pere David's deer has affected the re-growth of plants, which has led to insufficient natural food. Therefore, feeding supplement with silage is necessary. As a key nutritional factor, diet is the most important for the gut microbiota and metabolites of wild animals. In order to determine the effect of different dietary patterns on the nutrition and health of Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve in spring, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Pere David's deer feces by UPLC-MS/MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to reveal its intestinal chemical environment and the differences in the fecal microbiome. Altogether, our data explored the significant changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways during the transition from full silage to a combination diet with silage and plant in spring. These data provided important information to make more reasonable measures for Pere David's deer's protection. A deep understanding of the effect of seasonal dietary changes on the nutrition and health of Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve will contribute greatly to Pere David's deer's protection. In this reserve, there were three seasonal dietary regimes: feeding on naturally occurring plants (PLANT diet), silage (SILAGE diet), and a combination of natural plants and silage (COMB diet). To some extent, the COMB diet reflects the seasonal transition from silage to the all-natural plant diet, especially in early spring. However, little is known regarding the gut microbiota changes and metabolic consequences under the COMB diet. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites of Pere David's deer under these three diets were compared. Results showed the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota was significantly lower under the COMB diet compared to either the SILAGE or PLANT diets. Although no significant changes were observed in the core phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, among the three dietary regimes, a significant lower abundance of several other phyla (Spirochaetes, Melainabacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucobacteria) was observed in the COMB diet compared to the SILAGE diet. A greater number of fecal metabolite differences was identified between the COMB and SILAGE or COMB and PLANT diets than between the SILAGE and PLANT diets, suggesting that the COMB diet had more of an effect on the metabolism of Pere David's deer. The integrated pathway analysis showed that several metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the different dietary regimes, such as tryptophan metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and the platelet activation pathways. These metabolic changes reflect the responses and adaptations of Pere David's deer to different diets. Taken overall, our data reveal the difference in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways of Pere David's deer under three dietary regimes in Dafeng Reserve, which provides important information for Pere David's deer conservation.","[Zhen, Junai; Zhang, Huidan; Yuan, Xueli; Liu, Ping; Chen, Yuqing] Nanjing Normal Univ, Life Sci Coll, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Mol & Med Biotechnol, Nanjing 210000, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yijun; Wang, Libo; Shen, Hua] Jiangsu Dafeng Pere Davids Deer Natl Nat Reserve, Yancheng 224000, Peoples R China",Nanjing Normal University,"Chen, YQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Life Sci Coll, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Mol & Med Biotechnol, Nanjing 210000, Peoples R China.",191202090@njnu.edu.cn; ryijun2017@163.com; 201201029@njnu.edu.cn; 201202042@njnu.edu.cn; wanglibo2008@126.com; dfsh168@126.com; wanglibo2008@126.com; yuqingchen515@yahoo.com,,"Liu, Ping/0000-0001-5366-4618; chen, yuqing/0000-0001-9010-3713",Jiangsu Forestry Science and Technology Innovation and Promotion Project [LYKJ [2019] 49]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),Jiangsu Forestry Science and Technology Innovation and Promotion Project; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),FundingThis work was financially supported by a Jiangsu Forestry Science and Technology Innovation and Promotion Project (Grant No. LYKJ [2019] 49) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).,,47,2,2,5,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAR,2022,12,5,,,,,,,584,10.3390/ani12050584,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12050584,,,19,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,ZS2VW,35268151,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000768329000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Symbiotic microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tracts (gut) of vertebrates have mutual connections with host physiology and respond quickly to environmental alterations. However, the impact of anthropogenic changes and urbanisation on the gut microbiota remains poorly understood, especially in early development. To address this knowledge gap, we characterised the gut microbiota of juvenile great tits (Parus major) reared in artificial nestboxes and in natural cavities in an urban mosaic, employing two distinct frameworks characterising the urban space. Microbial diversity was influenced by cavity type. Alpha diversity was affected by the amount of impervious surface surrounding the breeding location, and positively correlated with tree cover density. Community composition differed between urban and rural sites: these alterations covaried with sound pollution and distance to the city centre. Overall, the microbial communities reflect and are possibly influenced by the heterogeneous environmental modifications that are typical of the urban space. Strikingly, the choice of framework and environmental variables characterising the urban space can influence the outcomes of such ecological studies. Our results open new perspectives to investigate the impact of microbial symbionts on the adaptive capacity of their hosts.","[Maraci, Oncu; Caspers, Barbara A.] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, Konsequenz 45, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany; [Corsini, Michela; Sudyka, Joanna; Di Lecce, Irene; Szulkin, Marta] Univ Warsaw, Ctr New Technol, Banacha St 2C, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland; [Antonatou-Papaioannou, Anna] Bielefeld Univ, Evolutionary Biol, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Antonatou-Papaioannou, Anna] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Zool, Koning Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Juenemann, Sebastian] Bielefeld Univ, Fac Technol, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Juenemann, Sebastian] Bielefeld Univ, Ctr Biotechnol CeBiTec, Sequenz 1, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Sudyka, Joanna] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ul Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland",University of Bielefeld; University of Warsaw; University of Bielefeld; Free University of Berlin; University of Bielefeld; University of Bielefeld; Jagiellonian University,"Maraci, O (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, Konsequenz 45, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany.",oncu.maraci@uni-bielefeld.de,"Caspers, Barbara A/C-5573-2011; Corsini, Michela/AAF-4181-2021; Sudyka, Joanna/AAO-6609-2020","Caspers, Barbara A/0000-0002-4380-0476; Corsini, Michela/0000-0001-5196-086X; Sudyka, Joanna/0000-0003-3006-3806; Maraci, Oncu/0000-0001-8837-7766","Research and Innovation Fund of the Faculty of Biology, Bielefeld University; Volkswagen Foundation; Polish National Science Foundation (NCN) [Sonata Bis 2014/14/E/NZ8/00386, OPUS 2021/41/B/NZ8/04472, OPUS 2016/21/B/NZ8/03082]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [031A533]; German Research Foundation (DFG); Bielefeld University","Research and Innovation Fund of the Faculty of Biology, Bielefeld University; Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); Polish National Science Foundation (NCN); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bielefeld University","We are grateful to Elke Hippauf, Barbara Fuchs, Tobias Busche, Yvonne Kutter and Katharina Hanuschka for their technical support during the laboratory procedures and to all members of the Wild Urban Evolution and Ecology Lab for collecting data in Warsaw and its surrounding regions.

The impact of domestication on animal physiology and behavior has been extensively studied, whereas its effect on the gut microbiota is still largely unexplored. For this reason, 16S rRNA gene-based and internal transcribed spacer-mediated bifidobacterial profiling, together with shotgun metagenomics, was employed to investigate the taxonomic composition and metabolic repertoire of 146 mammalian fecal samples, corresponding to 12 domesticated-feral dyads. Our results revealed that changes induced by domestication have extensively shaped the taxonomic composition of the mammalian gut microbiota. In this context, the selection of microbial taxa linked to a more efficient feed conversion into body mass and putative horizontal transmission of certain bacterial genera from humans were observed in the fecal microbiota of domesticated animals when compared to their feral relatives and to humans. In addition, profiling of the metabolic arsenal through metagenomics highlighted extensive functional adaptation of the fecal microbial community of domesticated mammals to changes induced by domestication. Remarkably, domesticated animals showed, when compared to their feral relatives, increased abundance of specific glycosyl hydrolases, possibly due to the higher intake of complex plant carbohydrates typical of commercial animal feeds.","[Alessandri, Giulia; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina] Univ Parma, Dept Vet Sci, Via Taglio 8, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Milani, Christian; Mancabelli, Leonardo; Mangifesta, Marta; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea; Duranti, Sabrina; Turroni, Francesca; Ventura, Marco] Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Lab Probiogen, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Viappiani, Alice] GenProbio Srl, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Turroni, Francesca; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina; Ventura, Marco] Univ Parma, Microbiome Res Hub, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [van Sinderen, Douwe] Natl Univ Ireland, APC Microbiome Inst, Western Rd, Cork, Ireland; [van Sinderen, Douwe] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Microbiol, Biosci Inst, Western Rd, Cork, Ireland",University of Parma; University of Parma; University of Parma,"Ventura, M (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Lab Probiogen, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy.",marco.ventura@unipr.it,"mangifesta, marta/AAW-1521-2020; Van Sinderen, Douwe/A-6778-2015; Mancabelli, Leonardo/AAV-5147-2021; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea/GRX-2617-2022; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea/AAV-5150-2021; ventura, marco/M-8230-2015; Turroni, Francesca/K-9660-2016; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina/A-6344-2016; Milani, Christian/ABA-8160-2020; Duranti, Sabrina/AAI-7916-2020","mangifesta, marta/0000-0002-0933-1071; Van Sinderen, Douwe/0000-0003-1823-7957; Mancabelli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1744-2214; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea/0000-0002-3024-0537; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea/0000-0002-3024-0537; Turroni, Francesca/0000-0001-5363-0231; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-2642-3709; Milani, Christian/0000-0002-5062-3164; Duranti, Sabrina/0000-0002-7724-5669","EU Joint Programming Initiative-A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life (JPI HDHL); Science Foundation Ireland [SFI] [15/JP-HDHL/3280]; MIUR, Italy; Fondazione Cariparma, under TeachInParma Project; Fondazione Cariparma, Parma, Italy; Laboratory of Probiogenomics","EU Joint Programming Initiative-A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life (JPI HDHL); Science Foundation Ireland [SFI](Science Foundation Ireland); MIUR, Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Fondazione Cariparma, under TeachInParma Project; Fondazione Cariparma, Parma, Italy; Laboratory of Probiogenomics","This work was primarily funded by the EU Joint Programming Initiative-A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life (JPI HDHL, http://www.healthydietforhealthylife.eu/) to DvS (in conjunction with Science Foundation Ireland [SFI] grant number 15/JP-HDHL/3280) and toMV (in conjunction with MIUR, Italy).

The mechanisms regulating the adaptive SIgA response towards gut microbes are poorly defined. Deletion of P2rx7, encoding for the ATP-gated ionotropic P2X7 receptor, leads to T follicular helper (Tfh) cells expansion in the Peyer's patches (PPs) of the small intestine, enhanced germinal centre (GC) reaction and IgA secretion; the resulting alterations of the gut microbiota in turn affects host metabolism. Here, we define gut microbiota modifications that correlate with deregulated SIgA secretion and metabolic alterations in P2rx7(-/-) mice. In particular, Lactobacillus shows enhanced SIgA coating in P2rx7(-/-) with respect to wild-type (WT) mice. The abundance of SIgA-coated lactobacilli positively correlates with Tfh cells number and body weight, suggesting Lactobacillus-specific SIgA response conditions host metabolism. Accordingly, oral administration of intestinal Lactobacillus isolates from P2rx7(-/-) mice to WT animals results in altered glucose homeostasis and fat deposition. Thus, enhanced SIgA production by P2X7 insufficiency promotes Lactobacillus colonization that interferes with systemic metabolic homeostasis.

The intestinal microecology plays an important role in the host's maintenance of normal physical activities, such as substance metabolism, energy transmission, signal transduction, and the immune system. This study used high-throughput sequencing technology to sequence the fecal microbiota of sika deer (Cervus nippon) and wapiti (Cervus canadensis) in order to explore the composition of, and the similarity between, the fecal microbiota structures of sika deer and wapiti in the similar living environment. The species composition, relative abundance of fecal microbiota, alpha diversity, and differences in beta diversity were analyzed. The maintenance of the composition of the gut microbiota and a balanced intestinal environment through the diet plays a key role in maintaining the host's health. The results demonstrate that the fecal microbiota of sika deer and wapiti share a similar fecal microbiota structure, but there was some evidence showing that the gut microbiota of these two animals exhibit a clear divergence at the species level. Microbial symbiotic associations may be beneficial, neutral, or harmful to the host. Symbionts exploit the host space and nutrition or use hosts as carriers to spread to other environments. In order to investigate the fecal bacterial communities of wild sika deer (Cervus nippon) and wapiti (Cervus canadensis), this study aimed to sequence and explore the composition of, and similarity between, the fecal microbiota of sika deer and wapiti using high-throughput sequencing. The composition and relative abundance of fecal microbiota, alpha diversity, and differences in beta diversity between the two species were analyzed. We found that no pathogenic bacteria were present in large quantities in the hosts. The dominant bacterial phyla found in the two deer species were similar and included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes. Moreover, the deer also shared similar dominant genera, including the Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Bacteroides. These results demonstrate that the sika deer and wapiti share a similar fecal microbiotal structure, probably due to their common diet and living environment, but there was some evidence of a difference at the species level. These analyses provide new insights into the health status of deer populations outside protected environments and offer a scientific framework for monitoring the health conditions of sika deer and wapiti.","[Yan, Jiakuo; Wu, Xiaoyang; Wang, Xibao; Shang, Yongquan; Zhang, Honghai] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University,"Zhang, HH (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhanghonghai67@126.com,,"Wang, Xibao/0000-0002-2036-5184","Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in Public Welfare [201404420]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31872242, 32070405, 31900311, 32000291, 32001228, 32170530]",Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in Public Welfare; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in Public Welfare (201404420) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31872242, 32070405, 31900311, 32000291, 32001228, 32170530).",,41,0,0,8,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,SEP,2022,12,18,,,,,,,2468,10.3390/ani12182468,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12182468,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,4Q6BH,36139327,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000856165700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Global temperature regimes are expected to undergo rapid shifts in the next century, yet for many animal taxa we lack an understanding of the consequences of these predicted shifts for animal populations. In this review, we synthesize recent evidence that temperature variation shapes the composition and function of animal gut microbiomes, key regulators of host physiology, with potential consequences for host population responses to climate change. Several recent studies spanning a range of animal taxa, including Chordata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca, have reported repeatable associations between temperature and the community composition and function of the gut microbiome. In several cases, the same microbiome responses to temperature have been observed across distantly related animal taxa, suggesting the existence of conserved mechanisms underlying temperature-induced microbiome plasticity. Extreme temperatures can disrupt the stability of alpha-diversity within the gut microbiomes individual hosts and generate beta-diversity among microbiomes within host populations. Microbiome states resulting from extreme temperatures have been associated, and in some cases causally linked, with both beneficial and deleterious effects on host phenotypes. We propose routes by which temperature-induced changes in the gut microbiome may impact host fitness, including effects on colonization resistance in the gut, on host energy and nutrient assimilation, and on host life history traits. Cumulatively, available data indicate that disruption of the gut microbiome may be a mechanism by which changing temperatures will impact animal fitness in wild-living populations.","[Sepulveda, Juan; Moeller, Andrew H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Moeller, AH (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",andrew.moeller@cornell.edu,"Moeller, Andrew/HPC-9802-2023",,,,,,56,75,78,16,85,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

The selective pressures imposed on insects by exposure to toxins may also be selective pressures on their symbiotic bacteria, who thus may contribute to the mechanism of toxin tolerance for the insect. Amatoxins are a class of cyclopeptide mushroom toxins that primarily act by binding to RNA polymerase II and inhibiting transcription. Several species of mycophagousDrosophilaare tolerant to amatoxins found in mushrooms of the genusAmanita, despite these toxins being lethal to most other known eukaryotes. These species can tolerate amatoxins in natural concentrations to utilize toxic mushrooms as larval hosts, but the mechanism by which these species are tolerant remains unknown. Previous data have shown that a local population ofD. tripunctataexhibits significant genetic variation in toxin tolerance. This study assesses the potential role of the microbiome in alpha-amanitin tolerance in six wild-derived strains ofDrosophila tripunctata. Normal and antibiotic-treated samples of six strains were reared on diets with and without alpha-amanitin, and then scored for survival from the larval stage to adulthood and for development time to pupation. Our results show that a substantial reduction in bacterial load does not influence toxin tolerance in this system, while confirming genotype and toxin-specific effects on survival are independent of the microbiome composition. Thus, we conclude that this adaptation to exploit toxic mushrooms as a host is likely intrinsic to the fly's genome and not a property of their microbiome.","[Griffin, Logan H.; Reed, Laura K.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Griffin, LH (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",lhgriffin@crimson.ua.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DEB-1737869],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1737869",,40,2,2,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Mammalian gut microbiota composition and diversity may be affected by a variety of factors including geographic variation, seasonal variation in diet, habitat disturbance, environmental conditions, age, and sex. However, there have been few studies that examined how ecological and environmental factors influence gut microbiota composition in animals' natural environments. In this study, we explore how host habitat, geographical location and environmental factors affect the fecal microbiota of Cynomys ludovicianus at a small spatial scale. We collected fecal samples from five geographically distinct locations in the Texas Panhandle classified as urban and rural areas and analyzed them using high throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.ResultsThe results showed that microbiota of these fecal samples was largely dominated by the phylum Bacteroidetes. Fecal microbiome diversity and composition differed significantly across sampling sites and habitats. Prairie dogs inhabiting urban areas showed reduced fecal diversity due to more homogenous environment and, likely, anthropogenic disturbance. Urban prairie dog colonies displayed greater phylogenetic variation among replicates than those in rural habitats. Differentially abundant analysis revealed that bacterial species pathogenic to humans and animals were highly abundant in urban areas which indicates that host health and fitness might be negatively affected. Random forest models identified Alistipes shahii as the important species driving the changes in fecal microbiome composition. Despite the effects of habitat and geographic location of host, we found a strong correlation with environmental factors and that- average maximum temperature was the best predictor of prairie dog fecal microbial diversity.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that reduction in alpha diversity in conjunction with greater dispersion in beta diversity could be indicative of declining host health in urban areas; this information may, in turn, help determine future conservation efforts. Moreover, several bacterial species pathogenic to humans and other animals were enriched in prairie dog colonies near urban areas, which may in turn adversely affect host phenotype and fitness.","[Neha, Sufia Akter; Salazar-Bravo, Jorge] Texas Tech Univ, Int Ctr Arid & Semiarid Land Studies, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Neha, Sufia Akter; Salazar-Bravo, Jorge] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Neha, SA (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Int Ctr Arid & Semiarid Land Studies, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.;Neha, SA (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",sneha@ttu.edu,,"Salazar-Bravo, Jorge/0000-0001-5905-2532",Graduate School of Texas Tech University,Graduate School of Texas Tech University,Research was funded by the Graduate School of Texas Tech University.,,131,0,0,2,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2180,,,BMC MICROBIOL,BMC Microbiol.,MAR 2,2023,23,1,,,,,,,51,10.1186/s12866-023-02778-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-023-02778-0,,,20,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,9M1BP,36858951,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000941973700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We and others have shown that feral mice as well as laboratory mice exposed to naturalistic environments harbor a more diverse gut microbiota and display an activated immunological phenotype compared to hygienic laboratory mice. We here describe a naturalistic indoors housing system for mice, representing a farmyard-type habitat typical for house mice. Large open pens were installed with soil and domestic animal feces, creating a highly diverse microbial environment and providing space and complexity allowing for natural behavior. Laboratory C57BL/6 mice were co-housed in this system together with wild-caught feral mice, included as a source of murine microbionts. We found that mice feralized in this manner displayed a gut microbiota structure similar to their feral cohabitants, such as higher relative content of Firmicutes and enrichment of Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the immunophenotype of feralized mice approached that of feral mice, with elevated levels of memory T-cells and late-stage NK cells compared to laboratory-housed control mice, indicating antigenic experience and immune training. The dietary elements presented in the mouse pens could only moderately explain changes in microbial colonization, and none of the immunological changes. In conclusion, this system enables various types of studies using genetically controlled mice on the background of adaptation to a high diversity microbial environment and a lifestyle natural for the species.","[Arnesen, Henriette; Knutsen, Linn Emilie; Hognestad, Bente Wabakken; Johansen, Grethe Marie; Storset, Anne Kristine; Boysen, Preben] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Oslo, Norway; [Arnesen, Henriette] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, As, Norway; [Bemark, Mats] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Biomed, Sahlgrenska Acad, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Bemark, Mats] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, Gothenburg, Region Vastra G, Sweden; [Pabst, Oliver] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Mol Med, Aachen, Germany",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; RWTH Aachen University,"Boysen, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Oslo, Norway.",preben.boysen@nmbu.no,"Boysen, Preben/C-5238-2013; Arnesen, Henriette/HOF-4004-2023; Bemark, Mats/B-2578-2019","Boysen, Preben/0000-0002-0084-1251; Arnesen, Henriette/0000-0003-1173-4010; Bemark, Mats/0000-0001-7416-9819","NMBU; Nansen Fund (Unifor, Norway)","NMBU; Nansen Fund (Unifor, Norway)","This research was funded internally at NMBU and the collaborators, microbiota analyses was supported by a grant from The Nansen Fund (Unifor, Norway).",,73,6,6,0,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

But the contribution of these drivers varies across host taxa and our ability to explain microbiome variability within wild populations remains limited. Terrestrial animals have divergent mobility ranges and can either crawl, walk or fly, from a couple of centimeters toward thousands of kilometers. Animal movement has been little regarded in host microbiota frameworks, though it can directly influence major drivers of the host microbiota: (1) Aggregation movement can enhance social transmissions, (2) foraging movement can extend range of diet diversity, and (3) dispersal movement determines the local environment of a host. Here, I would like to outline how movement behaviors of different host taxa matter for microbial acquisition across mammals, birds as well as insects. Host movement can have contrasting effects and either reduce or enlarge spatial scale. Increased dispersal movement could dissolve local effects of sampling location, while aggregation could enhance inter-host transmissions and uniformity among social groups. Host movement can also extend the boundaries of microbial dispersal limitations and connect habitat patches across plant-pollinator networks, while the microbiota of wild populations could converge toward a uniform pattern when mobility is interrupted in captivity or laboratory settings. Hence, the implementation of host movement would be a valuable addition to the metacommunity concept, to comprehend microbial dispersal within and across trophic levels.","[Weinhold, Arne] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol Cellular & Organism Networks, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Weinhold, A (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol Cellular & Organism Networks, Munich, Germany.",arne.weinhold@bio.lmu.de,"Weinhold, Arne/R-1739-2016","Weinhold, Arne/0000-0001-9999-7450",,,,,101,1,1,3,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Such effort allows us to amend their conservation strategies and tactics accordingly so that they are able to appropriately adapt to the new environment and dietary selection. In this study we focus on the gut flora of two groups of an endangered species, Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), wild group (WG) which is compared with that of the individuals of the same species but kept in the captivities (CG), a control group. Such a project is aimed to work out whether the composition of the gut microbes has significantly been changed due to captive feedings. To do so, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize gut bacteria of the musk deer from the two groups. The results show that there is a significant difference in community structure of the bacteria: WG shows significant enrichment of Firmicutes and depletion of Bacteroidetes, while CG has a significant abundance of Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota. Metagenomics was used to analyze the differences in functional enzymes between the two groups. The related results indicate that genes in WG are mostly related to the enzymes digesting cellulose and generating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) for signaling pathways, but CG shows enrichment in methanogenesis, including the CO2/H-2 pathway and the methylotrophic pathway. Thus, this study indicates that the Firmicutes-rich gut microbiota in the WG enables individuals to maximize their energy intake from the cellulose, and has significant abundance of Euryarchaeota and methanogenesis pathways that allow them to reduce redundant energy consumption in methane metabolism, ensuring them to adapt to the wild environments.","[Sun, Yewen; Shi, Zhihui; Zhu, Feng; Chen, Rui; Zhang, Jun; Pan, Ruliang; Li, Baoguo; Guo, Songtao] Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Anim Conservat, Xian, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yujiao; Liu, Zhensheng; Zhao, Chang; Gao, Hui; Teng, Liwei] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yujiao] Henan Univ Anim Husb & Econ, Coll Food & Biol Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhensheng] China State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Wildlife Conservat, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Lu, Taofeng] Guizhou Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Inst Lab Anim Sci, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ruliang] Univ Western Australia, Sch Human Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Teng, Liwei] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Harbin Vet Res Inst, Harbin, Peoples R China","Northwest University Xi'an; Northeast Forestry University - China; Henan University of Animal Husbandry & Economy; Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; University of Western Australia; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS","Guo, ST (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Anim Conservat, Xian, Peoples R China.;Teng, LW (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China.;Teng, LW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Harbin Vet Res Inst, Harbin, Peoples R China.",tenglw1975@163.com; songtaoguo@nwu.edu.cn,,"Pan, Ruliang/0000-0003-4467-2143; , Zhensheng Liu/0000-0001-5457-1536","National Key Program of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; Strategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31872247, 31372221]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2018JC-022]; Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China (Northwest University), Ministry of Education [ZSK2019006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572014CA03, DL13EA01]","National Key Program of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology; Strategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China (Northwest University), Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the National Key Program of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0503200); the Strategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB31000000); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31872247 and 31372221); the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2018JC-022); Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China (Northwest University), Ministry of Education (ZSK2019006); and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572014CA03 and DL13EA01).",,89,23,23,4,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

At present, RPHs cannot easily cope with climatic change, diseases and disturbance of other animals and need to be captured in the winters to be dewormed to increase their survival rate. Intestinal microbiota have been studied and are considered to be an important indicator to reflect the health status of the host. Thus, the differences in intestinal bacterial community composition and structure among RPHs, captive Przewalski's horses, sympatric domestic horses and sympatric Mongolian wild asses were analyzed in this study, which can help to evaluate the adaptability of RPH and provide important reference information for further development of protection strategies. Intestinal microbiota play an important role in the survival of the host. However, no study to date has elucidated the adjustment of intestinal microbiota of the host during rewilding. Thus, this study aims to describe the intestinal bacterial community of reintroduced Przewalski's horse (RPH) after being released into their original habitat for approximately 20 years in comparison with that of captive Przewalski's horse (CPH), sympatric domestic horse (DH) and Mongolian wild ass (MWA) by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that the prevalent bacterial communities were different among CPHs, RPHs, DHs and MWAs at the family level. NMDS and ANOSIM analysis showed that the pattern of bacterial community composition in captive equines was distinct from that in the wild groups. It is shown that some bacteria had significant differences among different taxa (p < 0.001), such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Armatimonadetes, Clostrida, Bacteroidia, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, Rikenellaceae and Bacteroidales_UCG-001. These bacteria were associated with the transition from in captive to in the wild (CPH and RPH), which reflected the change of environmental conditions. Meanwhile, Proteobacteria, Clostridia, Bacilli, Negativicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridiales, Bacillales, Selenomonadales, Pseudomonadales and Planococcaceae were the changed groups among RPHs, MWAs and DHs, which are related to feeding habits and diseases. Our results clearly showed the differences between intestinal microbiota in reintroduced animals and wild animals and led us to understand the survival state of reintroduced animals in the wild.","[Hu, Dini; Zhang, Ke; Zhang, Dong; Li, Kai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Qinghua East Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Xinjiang Kalamaili Ungulate Nat Reserve Managemen, Changji 831100, Peoples R China; [Ente, Make; Li, Xuefeng] Xinjiang Res Ctr Breeding Przewalskis Horse, Urumqi 831700, Peoples R China; [Chu, Hongjun] Xinjiang Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Urumqi 830063, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Li, K (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Qinghua East Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Chu, HJ (corresponding author), Xinjiang Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Urumqi 830063, Peoples R China.",likai_sino@sina.com; hongjunchu@vip.163.com,,"Hu, Dini/0000-0001-7784-3469",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020TQ0047]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670538]; Forestry Fund of LiBin grant [02210823],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Forestry Fund of LiBin grant,"This research was funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation grant number 2020TQ0047, National Natural Science Foundation of China grant number 31670538 and the Forestry Fund of LiBin grant number 02210823.",,58,0,0,8,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,OCT,2022,12,20,,,,,,,2874,10.3390/ani12202874,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12202874,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,5Q9PF,36290262,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000874153800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, deep metagenomic sequencing and assembly of gut compartment-specific samples from three sympatric, macroalgivorous Hawaiian kyphosid species have been used to connect host gut microbial taxa with predicted protein functional capacities likely to contribute to efficient macroalgal digestion. Bacterial community compositions, algal dietary sources, and predicted enzyme functionalities were analyzed in parallel for 16 metagenomes spanning the mid- and hindgut digestive regions of wild-caught fishes. Gene colocalization patterns of expanded carbohydrate (CAZy) and sulfatase (SulfAtlas) digestive enzyme families on assembled contigs were used to identify likely polysaccharide utilization locus associations and to visualize potential cooperative networks of extracellularly exported proteins targeting complex sulfated polysaccharides. These insights into the gut microbiota of herbivorous marine fish and their functional capabilities improve our understanding of the enzymes and microorganisms involved in digesting complex macroalgal sulfated polysaccharides.IMPORTANCE This work connects specific uncultured bacterial taxa with distinct polysaccharide digestion capabilities lacking in their marine vertebrate hosts, providing fresh insights into poorly understood processes for deconstructing complex sulfated polysaccharides and potential evolutionary mechanisms for microbial acquisition of expanded macroalgal utilization gene functions. Several thousand new marine-specific candidate enzyme sequences for polysaccharide utilization have been identified. These data provide foundational resources for future investigations into suppression of coral reef macroalgal overgrowth, fish host physiology, the use of macroalgal feedstocks in terrestrial and aquaculture animal feeds, and the bioconversion of macroalgae biomass into value-added commercial fuel and chemical products.

Migratory birds experience seasonal change in environments and diets throughout the course of the annual cycle that, along with recurrent biological events such as reproduction, may significantly impact their microbiota. In this study, we characterize the intestinal microbiota of four closely related species of migratory Catharus thrushes at three time points of their migratory cycle: during spring migration, on the summer breeding territories and during fall migration. Using observations replicated over 3 years, we determined that microbial community diversity of Catharus thrushes was significantly different across distinct time periods of the annual cycle, whereas community composition was more similar within than across years. Elevated alpha diversity in the summer birds compared to either migratory period indicated that birds may harbour a reduced microbiota during active migration. We also found that community composition of the microbiota did not substantially differ between host species. Finally, we recovered two phyla, Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetota, which are not commonly described from birds, that were in relatively high abundance in specific years. This study contributes to our growing understanding of how microbiota in wild birds vary throughout disparate ecological conditions and reveals potential axes across which an animal's microbial flexibility adapts to variable environments and recurrent biological conditions throughout the annual cycle.","[Skeen, Heather R.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL USA; [Skeen, Heather R.; Hackett, Shannon J.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Negaunee Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL USA; [Willard, David E.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Gantz Family Collect Ctr, Chicago, IL USA; [Jones, Andrew W.] Cleveland Museum Nat Hist, Dept Ornithol, Cleveland, OH USA; [Winger, Benjamin M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Zool, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Gyllenhaal, Ethan F.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Gyllenhaal, Ethan F.] Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Tsuru, Brian R.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH USA; [Novembre, John] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL USA; [Novembre, John] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL USA; [Skeen, Heather R.] Field Museum Birds, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Skeen, Heather R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Skeen, Heather R.] Spring Isl Trust, Okatie, SC USA",University of Chicago; Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago); Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago); Cleveland Museum of Natural History; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Connecticut,"Skeen, HR (corresponding author), Field Museum Birds, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",skeenhr@gmail.com,"Novembre, John/G-1339-2011","Jones, Andrew/0000-0003-1675-9225; Winger, Benjamin/0000-0002-2095-2020; Tsuru, Brian/0000-0002-7817-4102; Skeen, Heather/0000-0003-3269-031X; Hackett, Shannon/0000-0002-1404-0332; Gyllenhaal, Ethan/0000-0002-0835-8520",University of Chicago Microbiome Center Pilot Grant; Field Museum Grainger Bioinformatics Centre; Field Museum Women's Board; ARCS Foundation of Illinois; Illinois Ornithological Society,University of Chicago Microbiome Center Pilot Grant; Field Museum Grainger Bioinformatics Centre; Field Museum Women's Board; ARCS Foundation of Illinois; Illinois Ornithological Society,"We thank the many volunteers of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors Organization and The Field Museum Birds Prep Laboratory.

However, in some instances the translocated animals fail to thrive. Differences in diet between the source and destination areas may contribute to poor translocation outcomes, which could conceivably be exacerbated if the animals' microbiomes are unsuited to the new diet and cannot adapt. Methods: In this study we tracked how the faecal microbiome of a specialist Eucalyptus folivore, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), changed over the course of a year after translocation. We assessed microbiome composition by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of faecal pellets. Results: We found no significant overall changes in the faecal microbiomes of koalas post-translocation (n=17) in terms of microbial richness, diversity or composition when compared to the faecal microbiomes of koalas from an untranslocated control group (n=12). This was despite the translocated koalas feeding on a greater variety of Eucalyptus species after translocation. Furthermore, while differences between koalas accounted for half of the microbiome variation, estimated diets at the time of sampling only accounted for 5% of the variation in the koala microbiomes between sampling periods. By contrast, we observed that the composition of koala faecal microbiomes at the time of translocation accounted for 37% of between koala variation in post-translocation diet. We also observed that translocated koalas lost body condition during the first month post-translocation and that the composition of the koalas' initial microbiomes were associated with the magnitude of that change. Discussion: These findings suggest that the koala gut microbiome was largely unaffected by dietary change and support previous findings suggesting that the koala gut microbiome influences the tree species chosen for feeding. They further indicate that future research is needed to establish whether the koalas' gut microbiomes are directly influencing their health and condition or whether aspects of the koala gut microbiomes are an indicator of underlying physiological differences or pathologies. Our study provides insights into how animal microbiomes may not always be affected by the extreme upheaval of translocation and highlights that responses may be host species-specific. We also provide recommendations to improve the success of koala translocations in the future.","[Blyton, Michaela D. J.; Moore, Ben D.

Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of this invisible but often critical relationship is still in its infancy. We employed adult Neotropical butterflies as a study system to ask three questions: First, how does gut microbial community composition vary across host individuals, species and dietary guilds? Second, how do gut microbiota compare to food microbial communities? Finally, are gut flora functionally adapted to the chemical makeup of host foods? To answer these questions we captured nearly 300 Costa Rican butterflies representing over 50 species, six families, and two feeding guilds: frugivores and nectivores. We characterized bacteria and fungi in guts, wild fruits, and wild nectars via amplicon sequencing and assessed the catabolic abilities of the gut microbiota via culture-based assays. Gut communities were distinct from food communities, suggesting that the gut environment acts as a filter on potential colonists. Nevertheless, gut flora varied widely among individuals and species. On average, a pair of butterflies shared 21% of their bacterial species and 6% of their fungi. Host species explained 25-30% of variation in microbial communities while host diet explained 4%, suggesting that non-dietary aspects of host biology play a large role in structuring the butterfly gut flora. Much of the variation between species correlated with host phylogeny. Host diet was related to gut microbial function: compared to frugivores, nectivores' gut flora exhibited increased catabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols and decreased catabolism of amino acids, carboxylic acids, and dicarboxylic acids. Since fermented juice contains more amino acids and less sugar than nectar, it appears that host diet filters the gut flora by favoring microbes that digest compounds abundant in foods. By quantifying the degree to which gut communities vary among host individuals, species and dietary guilds and evaluating how gut microbial composition and catabolic potential are related to host diet, this study highlights the linkages between structure and function in one of the most complex and ubiquitous symbioses in the animal kingdom.","[Ravenscraft, Alison; Berry, Michelle; Peay, Kabir] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hammer, Tobin] Univ Colorado, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Boggs, Carol] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Ravenscraft, Alison] Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Hammer, Tobin] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Stanford University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Arizona; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Ravenscraft, A (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Ravenscraft, A (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",aravenscraft@gmail.com,"Ravenscraft, Alison/U-5500-2019","Ravenscraft, Alison/0000-0003-4974-4804; Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412","NSF; Stanford Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics; NIH PERT postdoctoral fellowship; Stanford University; Stanford University's Biology Department; Stanford University's Center for Latin American Studies; Stanford University's Biosciences Office of Graduate Education","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Stanford Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics; NIH PERT postdoctoral fellowship(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Stanford University(Stanford University); Stanford University's Biology Department; Stanford University's Center for Latin American Studies; Stanford University's Biosciences Office of Graduate Education","A.

Integrative studies of animals and associated microbial assemblages (i.e., the holobiont) are rapidly changing our perspectives on organismal ecology and evolution. Insular vertebrates provide ideal natural systems to understand patterns of host-gut microbiota coevolution, the resilience and plasticity these microbial communities over temporal and spatial scales, and ultimately their role in the host ecological adaptation.Methods. Here we used the endemic Balearic wall lizard Podarcis lilfordi to dissect the drivers of the microbial diversity within and across host allopatric populations/islets. By focusing on three extensively studied populations/islets of Mallorca (Spain) and fecal sampling from individually identified lizards along two years (both in spring and autumn), we sorted out the effect of islet, sex, life stage, year and season on the microbiota composition. We further related microbiota diversity to host genetics, trophic ecology and expected annual metabolic changes.Results. All the three populations showed a remarkable conservation of the major microbial taxonomic profile, while carrying their unique microbial signature at finer level of taxonomic resolution (Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs)). Microbiota distances across populations were compatible with both host genetics (based on microsatellites) and trophic niche distances (based on stable isotopes and fecal content). Within populations, a large proportion of ASVs (30-50%) were recurrently found along the four sampling dates. The microbial diversity was strongly marked by seasonality, with no sex effect and a marginal life stage and annual effect. The microbiota showed seasonal fluctuations along the two sampled years, primarily due to changes in the relative abundances of fermentative bacteria (mostly families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae), without any major compositional turnover.Conclusions. These results support a large resilience of the major compositional aspects of the P. lilfordi gut microbiota over the short-term evolutionary divergence of their host allopatric populations (<10,000 years), but also indicate an undergoing process of parallel diversification of the both host and associated gut microbes. Predictable seasonal dynamics in microbiota diversity suggests a role of microbiota plasticity in the lizards' metabolic adaptation to their resource-constrained insular environments. Overall, our study supports the need for longitudinal and integrative studies of host and associated microbes in natural systems.","[Baldo, Laura; Riera, Joan Lluis] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Baldo, Laura] Inst Res Biodivers IRBio, Barcelona, Spain; [Tavecchia, Giacomo; Rotger, Andreu; Igual, Jose Manuel] CSIC, Anim Demog & Ecol Unit, IMEDEA, Esporles, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao,"Baldo, L (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Barcelona, Spain.;Baldo, L (corresponding author), Inst Res Biodivers IRBio, Barcelona, Spain.",baldo.laura@ub.edu,"Igual, Jose/N-3975-2014; Rotger, Andreu/Y-3112-2018","Igual, Jose/0000-0002-8369-3150; Rotger, Andreu/0000-0002-9093-9497",Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [CGL2017-82986-C2-2-P]; CAIB - Government of the Balearic Islands [PRD2018/25],Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)(European CommissionSpanish Government); CAIB - Government of the Balearic Islands,"This study was supported by the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) (CGL2017-82986-C2-2-P) to L.B. and by the project PRD2018/25 (CAIB - Government of the Balearic Islands) to G.T.

Deficiencies in any one of the these pathways can lead to complications, such as calcium oxalate urinary stones. While considerable research has been conducted on individual oxalate-degrading bacterial isolates, interactions between oxalate and the gut microbiota as a whole are unknown. We examined the reduction in oxalate excretion in a rat model following oral administration of fecal microbes from a mammalian herbivore adapted to a high oxalate diet or to fecal transplants consisting of two different formulations of mixed oxalate-degrading isolates. While all transplants elicited a significant reduction in oxalate excretion initially, the greatest effect was seen with fecal microbial transplants, which persisted even in the absence of dietary oxalate. The reduction in oxalate excretion in animals given fecal transplants corresponded with the establishment of diverse bacteria, including known oxalate-degrading bacteria and a cohesive network of bacteria centered on oxalate-degrading specialists from the Oxalobacteraceae family. Results suggested that the administration of a complete community of bacteria facilitates a cohesive balance in terms of microbial interactions. Our work offers important insights into the development of targeted bacteriotherapies intended to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in patients at risk for recurrent calcium oxalate stones as well as bacteriotherapies targeting other toxins for elimination. IMPORTANCE Oxalate is a central component in 80% of kidney stones. While mammals do not possess the enzymes to degrade oxalate, many gastrointestinal bacteria are efficient oxalate degraders. We examined the role of cohesive microbial networks for oxalate metabolism, using Sprague-Dawley rats as a model host. While the transplantation of oxalate-degrading bacteria alone to the Sprague-Dawley hosts did increase oxalate metabolism, fecal transplants from a wild mammalian herbivore, Neotoma albigula, had a significantly greater effect. Furthermore, the boost for oxalate metabolism persisted only in animals that received fecal transplants. Animals receiving fecal transplants had a more diverse and cohesive network of bacteria associated with the Oxalobacteraceae, a family known to consist of specialist oxalate-degrading bacteria, than did animals that received oxalate-degrading bacteria alone. Our results indicate that fecal transplants are more effective at transferring specific functions than are microbial specialists alone, which has broad implications for the development of bacteriotherapies.","[Miller, Aaron W.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Urol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Miller, Aaron W.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Immunol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Miller, Aaron W.; Dale, Colin; Dearing, M.

This study investigated the scale and pattern of genetic differentiation between bacteria of the family Acetobacteraceae isolated from the guts of Drosophila fruit flies, plant material and industrial fermentations. Genome-scale analysis of the phylogenetic relationships and predicted functions was conducted on 44 Acetobacteraceae isolates, including newly sequenced genomes from 18 isolates from wild and laboratory Drosophila. Isolates from the external environment and Drosophila could not be assigned to distinct phylogenetic groups, nor are their genomes enriched for any different sets of genes or category of predicted gene functions. In contrast, analysis of bacteria from laboratory Drosophila showed they were genetically distinct in their universal capacity to degrade uric acid (a major nitrogenous waste product of Drosophila) and absence of flagellar motility, while these traits vary among wild Drosophila isolates. Analysis of the competitive fitness of Acetobacter discordant for these traits revealed a significant fitness deficit for bacteria that cannot degrade uric acid in culture with Drosophila. We propose that, for wild populations, frequent cycling of Acetobacter between Drosophila and the external environment prevents genetic differentiation by maintaining selection for traits adaptive in both the gut and external habitats. However, laboratory isolates bear the signs of adaptation to persistent association with the Drosophila host under tightly defined environmental conditions.","[Winans, Nathan J.; Chouaia, Bessem; Chaston, John M.; Douglas, Angela E.; Newell, Peter D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Walter, Alec; Newell, Peter D.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Chaston, John M.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY USA; [Winans, Nathan J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurosurg, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chouaia, Bessem] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Milan, Italy",Cornell University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) - Oswego; Brigham Young University; Cornell University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Milan,"Newell, PD (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA.",peter.newell@oswego.edu,,"chouaia, bessem/0000-0003-0726-7237",National Science Foundation [DEB-1241099]; National Institutes of Health [R01GM095372]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [1F32GM099374-01]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1241099] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1241099; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01GM095372; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 1F32GM099374-01",,65,34,34,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

All jawed vertebrates share mucosal immunity dedicated to isolating the microbiota, and a breakdown of this system can result in chronic gut inflammation. In humans, chronic gut inflammation negatively affects growth and development. There is little information available on the prevalence of chronic gut inflammation in wild animals, but given that animals with different life histories emphasize different immune responses, it follows that wild animals may vary in their susceptibility to chronic gut inflammation, and most animals will experience signaling that can lead to this state. These can be top-down signals originating from sources like the central nervous system or bottom-up signals originating from changes in the gut microbiota. The sources of these signals might include stress, developmental transitions, food restriction, and dietary shifts. Here, we briefly discuss host-microbiota interactions from the perspective of life history theory and ecoimmunology, focusing on the mucosal immune system and chronic gut inflammation. We also include future directions for research and the tools necessary to investigate them.","[Kirschman, Lucas J.; Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn C.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Kirschman, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",ljkirschman@alaska.edu,,"Kirschman, Lucas/0000-0002-2625-3124",,,,,182,2,2,1,19,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

The interplay between hosts and their resident bacteria inevitably affects the intestinal environment and, thereby, the living conditions of both the host and the microbiota. Thereby this co-existence likely influences the fitness of both bacteria and host. Whether this co-existence leads to evolutionary co-diversification in animals is largely unexplored, mainly due to the complexity of the environment and microbial communities and the often low host selection. We present the gut metagenome from wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a new wild organism model with an intestinal microbiota of low complexity and a well-described population structure, making it well-suited for investigating co-evolution. Our data reveal a strong host selection of a core gut microbiota dominated by a single Mycoplasma species. We found a clear co-diversification between the population structure of Atlantic salmon and nucleotide variability of the intestinal Mycoplasma populations conforming to expectations from co-evolution between host and resident bacteria. Our results show that the stable microbiota of Atlantic salmon has evolved with its salmonid host populations while potentially providing adaptive traits to the salmon host populations, including defence mechanisms, biosynthesis of essential amino acids, and metabolism of B vitamins. We highlight Atlantic salmon as a novel model for studying co-evolution between vertebrate hosts and their resident bacteria.","[Rasmussen, Jacob A.; Kristiansen, Karsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Lab Genom & Mol Biomed, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rasmussen, Jacob A.; Gilbert, M.

The bacteria that individuals acquire as they age may therefore have a profound effect on their future fitness. Since most birds are capable of flight, they can be widely distributed in and adapted to various ecosystems. Moreover, birds are also challenged by the need to digest a wide range of food resources in their guts. However, little is known regarding how the microbial community structure in birds, especially wild birds, changes with host age.

The results showed that the phyla Proteobacteria (52.45%), Firmicutes (13.87%), Bacteroidetes (5.76%), Actinobacteria (4.95%), Planctomycetes (4.36%), Euryarchaeota (3.20%), Acidobacteria (2.59%), Fusobacteria (2.24%), and Chloroflexi (1.8%) dominated the gut microbial communities in Jankowski's bunting. There was no significant difference in the alpha diversity and richness among different age groups. There was also no significant difference in species richness and diversity between the nestlings and adults. However, we observed different bacterial compositions at the genus level. The generaPhotobacteriumandBrochothrixwere detected only in the nestling groups (at days 3, 6, and 9), whileDiplorickettsiawas detected only in the adult group. In summary, this study can provide additional information regarding the intestinal microorganisms of wild passerine and grassland birds and provide theoretical evidence for methods to protect Jankowski's bunting.","[Shang, Weiping; Li, Shi; Zhang, Lishi; Jiang, Yunlei] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hui] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University; Jilin Agricultural University,"Jiang, YL (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun, Peoples R China.",jiangyl487@nenu.edu.cn,,,,,,,38,3,3,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0343-8651,1432-0991,,CURR MICROBIOL,Curr.

Marmosets also feed heavily on tree gums and exudates, and they have evolved unique morphological and anatomical characteristics to facilitate gum feeding (gummivory). In this study, we characterized the fecal micro biomes of adult and infant animals from a captive population of common marmosets at the Callitrichid Research Center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha under their normal dietary and environmental conditions. The microbiomes of adult animals were dominated by species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium, Megamonas, and Megasphaera. Culturing and genomic analysis of the Bifidobacterium populations from adult animals identified four known marmoset-associated species (B. reuteri, B. aesculapii, B. myosotis, and B. hapali) and three unclassified taxa of Bifidobacterium that are phylogenetically distinct. Species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that these same species of Bifidobacterium are abundant members of the microbiome throughout the lives of the animals. Genomic loci in each Bifidobacterium species encode enzymes to support growth and major marmoset milk oligosaccharides during breastfeeding; however, metabolic islands that can support growth on complex polysaccharide substrates in the diets of captive adults (pectin, xyloglucan, and xylan), including loci in B. aesculapii that can support its unique ability to grow on arabinogalactan-rich tree gums, were species-specific. IMPORTANCE Bifidobacterium species are recognized as important, beneficial microbes in the human gut microbiome, and their ability colonize individuals at different stages of life is influenced by host, dietary, environmental, and ecological factors, which is poorly understood. The common marmoset is an emerging nonhuman primate model with a short maturation period, making this model amenable to study the microbiome throughout a life history. Features of the microbiome in captive marmosets are also shared with human gut microbiomes, including abundant populations of Bifidobacterium species. Our studies show that several species of Bifidobacterium are dominant members of the captive marmoset microbiome throughout their life history. Metabolic capacities in genomes of the marmoset Bifidobacterium species suggest species-specific adaptations to different components of the captive marmoset diet, including the unique capacity in B. aesculapii for degradation of gum arabic, suggesting that regular dietary exposure in cap- tivity may be important for preserving gum-degrading species in the microbiome.","[Zhu, Lifeng; Hassenstab, Haley; Mustoe, Aaryn; French, Jeffrey] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Zhu, Lifeng; Yang, Qinnan; Haute, Mallory J.

However, the underlying mechanisms at the immune-microbe interface remain largely unknown. MethodsThe effects of repeated intranasal AL exposure on local and systemic innate immune responses were investigated in wild-type and Il6(-/-), Il10(-/-), and Il17(-/-) mice exposed to ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation. Those investigations were expanded by microbiome analyses. To assess for AL-associated changes in gene expression, the picture arising from animal data was supplemented by in vitro experiments of macrophage and T-cell responses, yielding expression and epigenetic data. ResultsThe asthma preventive effect of AL was confirmed in the lung. Repeated intranasal AL administration triggered a proinflammatory immune response particularly characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, and consequently, IL-6 induced IL-10 production in CD4(+) T-cells. Both IL-6 and IL-10, but not IL-17, were required for asthma protection. AL had a profound impact on the gene regulatory landscape of CD4(+) T-cells which could be largely recapitulated by recombinant IL-6. AL administration also induced marked changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome but not in the lung microbiome. By comparing the effects on the microbiota according to mouse genotype and AL-treatment status, we have identified microbial taxa that were associated with either disease protection or activity. ConclusionThese experiments provide a novel mechanism of Acinetobacter lwoffii-induced asthma protection operating through IL-6-mediated epigenetic activation of IL-10 production and with associated effects on the intestinal microbiome.","[Alhamwe, Bilal Alashkar; Alhamdan, Fahd; Harb, Hani; Kesper, Dorthe; Potaczek, Daniel P.; Renz, Harald] Philipps Univ Marburg, German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Inst Lab Med, Marburg, Germany; [Alhamwe, Bilal Alashkar; Alhamdan, Fahd; Harb, Hani; Kesper, Dorthe; Garn, Holger; Potaczek, Daniel P.; Renz, Harald] Philipps Univ Marburg, Univ Giessen & Marburg Lung Ctr UGMLC, Marburg, Germany; [Alhamwe, Bilal Alashkar] Philipps Univ Marburg, Clin Hematol Oncol & Immunol, Inst Tumor Immunol, Ctr Tumor Biol & Immunol ZTI, Marburg, Germany; [Alhamwe, Bilal Alashkar] Int Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Coll Pharm, Daraa, Syria; [Gao, Zhan; Blaser, Martin J.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Alhamdan, Fahd] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med Pulm & Crit Care Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Alhamdan, Fahd; Garn, Holger; Potaczek, Daniel P.] Philipps Univ Marburg, Translat Inflammat Res Div, Marburg, Germany; [Alhamdan, Fahd; Garn, Holger; Potaczek, Daniel P.] Philipps Univ Marburg, Core Facil Single Cell Multi, Marburg, Germany; [Alhamdan, Fahd; Garn, Holger; Potaczek, Daniel P.] Philipps Univ Marburg, German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Marburg, Germany; [Harb, Hani] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Med Microbiol & Virol, Dresden, Germany; [Harb, Hani] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Psychoneuroimmunol Lab, Giessen, Germany; [Pichene, Matthieu; Garnier, Abel; Daviaud, Christian; Tost, Joerg] Univ Paris Saclay, Ctr Natl Rech Genom Humaine, CEA Inst Biol Francois Jacob, Lab Epigenet & Environm, Evry, France; [El Andari, Jihad; Graumann, Peter L.] Philipps Univ Marburg, LOEWE Ctr Synthet Microbiol, SYNMIKRO, Marburg, Germany; [El Andari, Jihad; Graumann, Peter L.] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Chem, Marburg, Germany; [Kaufmann, Andreas] Philipps Univ Marburg, Inst Immunol, Marburg, Germany; [Potaczek, Daniel P.] Bioscientia MVZ Lab Mittelhessen GmbH, Giessen, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Technische Universitat Dresden; Justus Liebig University Giessen; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg,"Renz, H (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Inst Lab Med, Baldinger Str, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",harald.renz@uk-gm.de,", Prof. Dr Harald Renz/HRB-7768-2023; Tost, Joerg/H-7129-2019",", Prof. Dr Harald Renz/0000-0003-0602-7215; Tost, Joerg/0000-0002-2683-0817; Alashkar Alhamwe, Bilal/0000-0002-7120-0013; EL Andari, Jihad (Josef)/0000-0001-5502-6214; Harb, Hani/0000-0001-8218-2538","DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service [91726294, 91559386]; DFG, German Research Foundation [416910386-GRK 2573/1]; DZL German Lung Center [82DZL00502]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [U01 AI22285]; Transatlantic Program of the Fondation Leducq; C&D and Sergei Zlinkoff funds","DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); DFG, German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DZL German Lung Center; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Transatlantic Program of the Fondation Leducq; C&D and Sergei Zlinkoff funds","DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service; personal reference number 91726294; DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service; personal reference number 91559386; DFG, German Research Foundation; Grant 416910386-GRK 2573/1; DZL German Lung Center, no. 82DZL00502; The National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant no.

Correspondingly, monumental human and financial resources have been invested in biomedical research, with a mission to decode the mechanisms of ageing and how these contribute to age-related disease. Multiple hallmarks of ageing have been identified that are common across taxa, highlighting their fundamental importance. These include dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and telomeres biology, epigenetic modifications, cell-matrix interactions, proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion, inflammageing and immuno-senescence. While our understanding of the molecular basis of ageing is improving, it remains a complex and multifactorial process that remains to be fully understood. A key aspect of the shortfall in our understanding of the ageing process lies in translating data from standard animal models to humans. Consequently, we suggest that a 'biomimetic' and comparative approach, integrating knowledge from species in the wild, as opposed to inbred genetically homogenous laboratory animals, can provide powerful insights into human ageing processes. Here we discuss some particularities and comparative patterns among several species from the animal kingdom, endowed with longevity or short lifespans and unique metabolic profiles that could be potentially exploited to the understanding of ageing and age-related diseases. Based upon lessons from nature, we also highlight several avenues for renewed focus in the pathophysiology of ageing and age-related disease (i.e. diet-microbiome-health axis, oxidative protein damage, adaptive homoeostasis and planetary health). We propose that a biomimetic alliance with collaborative research from different disciplines can improve our understanding of ageing and age-related diseases with long-term sustainable utility.","[Dai, Lu; Stenvinkel, Peter] Karolinska Inst, Div Renal Med, Dept Clin Sci Intervent & Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Schurgers, Leon] Maastricht Univ, Dept Biochem, Cardiovasc Res Sch Maastricht CARIM, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Schurgers, Leon] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Expt Med & Syst Biol, Aachen, Germany; [Shiels, Paul G.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Canc Sci, Wolfson Wohl Translat Res Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Karolinska Institutet; Maastricht University; RWTH Aachen University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Glasgow,"Stenvinkel, P (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Div Renal Med, Dept Clin Sci Intervent & Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.stenvinkel@ki.se,"Dai, Lu/ACC-9112-2022; Schurgers, Leon/AAT-7100-2021","Stenvinkel, Peter/0000-0002-8785-4820; Schurgers, Leon/0000-0001-7867-6957; Shiels, Paul/0000-0002-7577-9843",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [722609]; Strategic Research Program in Diabetes at Karolinska Institutet (Swedish Research Council) [2009-1068]; Heart and Lung Foundation; CIMED,European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; Strategic Research Program in Diabetes at Karolinska Institutet (Swedish Research Council); Heart and Lung Foundation(Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation); CIMED,This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie (www.intricare.eu) [grant number 722609]; Strategic Research Program in Diabetes at Karolinska Institutet (Swedish Research Council) [grant number 2009-1068]; the Heart and Lung Foundation (to P.S.); CIMED (to P.S.).,,190,4,4,4,8,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"1ST FLR, 10 QUEEN STREET PLACE, LONDON, ENGLAND",0143-5221,1470-8736,,CLIN SCI,Clin.

Examining evidence accumulated in the literature up to date, we note that the gut microbiome is involved in the increased social behavior of domesticated species through the gut-immune system-brain axis. We further discuss data that point toward clear difference in the microbiome composition between domesticated species and closely related wild ancestors. This difference is related to changes in diet, due to co-habitation with humans, which leads to increase in Bifidobacteria and changes in carbohydrate metabolism. We note that these changes may also influence interaction between microbiome and virome. Virome is linked to the evolutionary changes through incorporation of retro-viruses into the host genome. Together with transposons these mobile genetic elements may also lead to changes in regulatory networks, and increase adaptive potential. Changes in microbiome of animals during co-habitation with humans should be considered as an important event during domestication process.","[Glazko, Valeriy, I; Glazko, Tatyana T.] FSBEI HPE Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad, Moscow, Russia; [Glazko, Valeriy, I; Kosovsky, Yu G.; Glazko, Tatyana T.] FSBSI VA Afanasyev RI Fur & Rabbit Farming, Moscow, Russia; [Zybaylov, Boris L.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 4301 W Markham, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Glazko, Galina, V] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biomed Informat, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences,"Zybaylov, BL (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 4301 W Markham, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",blzybaylov@uams.edu,"Kosovsky, Gleb/ABG-7304-2020; Valeriy, Glazko/Q-3017-2019","Zybailov, Boris/0000-0003-2432-9145",NIH Center of Biomedical Research Excellence [P20GM121293],NIH Center of Biomedical Research Excellence(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The publication of this article was supported by P20GM121293/NIH Center of Biomedical Research Excellence.",,46,2,3,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,OCT,2021,31,10,,,,,1635,1645,9.59684E+15,10.1177/09596836211025975,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211025975,,JUL 2021,11,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,UA0JC,,,,,2023-06-01,WOS:000675169300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite many studies documenting the microbial taxa associated with animals, the pattern and ecological determinants of among-animal variation in microbial communities are poorly understood. This study quantified the bacterial communities associated with natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Across five collections, each fly bore 16-78 OTUs, predominantly of the Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Positive relationships, mostly among related OTUs, dominated both the significant co-occurrences and co-association networks among bacteria, and OTUs with important network positions were generally of intermediate abundance and prevalence. The prevalence of most OTUs was well predicted by a neutral model suggesting that ecological drift and passive dispersal contribute significantly to microbiome composition. However, some Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae were present in more flies than predicted, indicative of superior among-fly dispersal. These taxa may be well-adapted to the Drosophila habitat from the perspective of dispersal as the principal benefit of the association to the microbial partners. Taken together, these patterns indicate that both stochastic processes and deterministic processes relating to the differential capacity for persistence in the host habitat and transmission between hosts contribute to bacterial community assembly in Drosophila melanogaster.","[Adair, Karen L.; Wilson, Marita; Bost, Alyssa; Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Douglas, AE (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Douglas, AE (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",aes326@cornell.edu,,,NSF [BIO1241099],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank John McMullen for assistance with fly collections and Vince Martinson for technical advice.

If loss of gut biodiversity threatens the health (and therefore the fitness of individuals), and this loss can be correlated with the adaptive potential of a species in changing environments, measuring functional composition of the microbiota from non-invasive samples, such as faeces and skin swabs, could provide a useful and practical tool for determining conservation priorities. This article reviews the evidence for adaptive potential of microbiota in wild species, and proposes future directions. While there is ample indication of inter- and intra-specific variation in microbiota diversity, there is little evidence that diversity per se confers fitness. However, there are convincing examples showing that microbiota flexibility, composition and function may well be sources of adaptive potential, although case studies are relatively few, and the analytical approaches needed to demonstrate the mechanisms underlying host-microbiota interactions have only recently been developed.","[Hauffe, Heidi C.; Barelli, Claudia] Fdn E Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [Barelli, Claudia] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, 109 Davenport Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Barelli, Claudia] Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL USA",Fondazione Edmund Mach; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Hauffe, HC (corresponding author), Fdn E Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",heidi.hauffe@fmach.it,"Barelli, Claudia/HZH-9698-2023; Hauffe, Heidi Christine/AAU-1684-2021","Hauffe, Heidi Christine/0000-0003-3098-8964",European Union [752399],European Union(European Commission),The writing of this article has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 752399 (WILDGUT).,,106,33,33,2,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1566-0621,1572-9737,,CONSERV GENET,Conserv.

Much of the information on the gut microbiota-host relationship to date derives from studies of laboratory model organisms, while little is known concerning wild animals and their ecological relevance to gut microbes. It is also unclear how micro-bial community composition and activity adapt to changes in diet and energy, nutri-tional requirements, and utilization induced by dietary expansion from invertebrates to vertebrates. The great evening bat (Ia io) is both an insectivore and an avivore (that is, a bird-eater), and thus provides an opportunity to investigate the diet-host-microbiota-physiology relationship. Here, we investigated this relationship by using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and functional prediction in adult males of I. io. We found that gut microbial diversity was similar, while microbial community structures were significantly different between insectivorous and avivorous diets. Moreover, increases in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, changes in carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism, and a decrease in Pseudomonas were associated with higher energy demands for hunting birds and with fat storage for entering hibernation and migration. These findings demonstrated that seasonal dietary shifts drive a significant change in the compo-sition and function of gut microbiomes, thereby facilitating adaptation to the chal-lenging avian dietary niche in bats. These results suggest that the gut microbial communities can constantly respond to alterations in diets, potentially facilitating the diversity of wild animal dietary niches, and enhance our understanding of the diet-host-microbiota-physiology relationship. IMPORTANCE The coevolution between the host and its gut microbes can promote an animal's adaptation to its specific ecological niche and changes in energy and nutritional requirements. This study focused on an avivorous bat, the great evening bat (Ia io), to investigate how seasonal dietary shifts affect the gut microbial compo-sition and function, thereby facilitating adaptation to an avian diet. We found that seasonal dietary shifts driving a significant change in the composition and function of gut microbiomes in I. io were associated with higher energy demands for hunting birds and fat storage for entering hibernation and migration. Our study provides novel insight into the role of gut bacteria in generating ecological diversity and flexi-bility in wild mammals. The results are valuable for clarifying the complicated host-microbiota-physiology relationship in a dietary niche expansion context.","[Gong, Lixin; Feng, Jiang; Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Util, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Gong, Lixin; Feng, Jiang; Jiang, Tinglei] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Educ Minist, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Liu, Boyu] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hui; Feng, Jiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China; Jilin Agricultural University; Jilin Agricultural University,"Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Util, Changchun, Peoples R China.;Jiang, TL (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Educ Minist, Changchun, Peoples R China.",jiangtl730@nenu.edu.cn,"Jiang, Tinglei/GQQ-9485-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31922050, 31872680]; Fund of the Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Project [20200201186JC]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fund of the Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Project,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 31922050 and 31872680) and the Fund of the Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Project (grant no. 20200201186JC).,,62,7,7,14,51,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",,2379-5042,,MSPHERE,mSphere,JUL-AUG,2021,6,4,,,,,,,e00467-21,10.1128/mSphere.00467-21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00467-21,,,14,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,YX1WR,34346703,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000753900300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these studies are often confounded by numerous factors. Selection experiments offer unique opportunities to validate conclusions and test hypotheses generated by comparative studies. We used a replicated, 15-generation selection experiment on bank voles (Myodes glareolus) that have been selected for high swim-induced aerobic metabolism, predatory behavior toward crickets, and the ability to maintain body mass on a high-fiber, herbivorous diet. We predicted that selection on host performance, mimicking adaptive radiation, would result in distinct microbial signatures. We collected foregut and cecum samples from animals that were all fed the same nutrient-rich diet and had not been subjected to any performance tests. We conducted microbial inventories of gut contents by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found no differences in cecal microbial community structure or diversity between control lines and the aerobic or predatory lines. However, the cecal chambers of voles selected for herbivorous capability harbored distinct microbial communities that exhibited higher diversity than control lines. The foregut communities of herbivorous-selected voles were also distinct from control lines. Overall, this experiment suggests that differences in microbial communities across herbivorous mammals may be evolved, and not solely driven by current diet or other transient factors.","[Kohl, Kevin D.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Sadowska, Edyta T.; Rudolf, Agata M.; Koteja, Pawel] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Dearing, M.

Although pangolin are protected animals in China and listed as critically endangered (CR) level by The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the population of wild pangolins has decreased sharply in recent decades. Captive breeding has been adopted to protect pangolins, but the survival is low due to gastrointestinal infections, diarrhea, and parasitic infections. Studies on intestinal microbes in pangolins may reveal the relationship between intestinal microorganisms and health and assist protection. To explore the relationship between intestinal microorganisms and pangolin health, blood parameters and intestinal microorganisms of 10 pangolins (two Manis pentadactyla and eight Manis javanica) were studied at the Shenzhen Wildlife Rescue Center. There is difference among adult Sunda pangolins (M. javanica), adult Chinese pangolins (M. pentadactyla) and sub-adult Sunda pangolins (M. javanica) in intestinal microbial composition, diversity and phenotypic diversity, which suggested that adult Sunda pangolins occupied more diversity and proportion of microbial species to resist environmental pressure than the others. Due to the captive breeding serum cortisol of pangolins was increased, and the intestinal microbial structure changed, which may affect immunity. This study provides a scientific basis for the rescue of pangolins through artificial breeding.","[Jiao, Wenjing; Li, Linmiao; Chen, Jinping] Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utiliz, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lina; Zeng, Zhiliao] Shenzhen Management Bur Nat Reserve, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences","Jiao, WJ; Chen, JP (corresponding author), Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utiliz, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",wenjinganni87@163.com; chenjp@giz.gd.cn,,,Biodiversity Maintenance Mechanism and Regional Biosafety Innovation Research in Lingnan;  [2022GDASZH-2022010106],Biodiversity Maintenance Mechanism and Regional Biosafety Innovation Research in Lingnan; ,Funding This study was supported by the Biodiversity Maintenance Mechanism and Regional Biosafety Innovation Research in Lingnan (2022GDASZH-2022010106).,,36,0,0,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Here we employ wild three-spined sticklebacks as a model, combining field observations with complementary experimental manipulations of diet designed to mimic seasonal variation in the wild. We clearly demonstrate that season-specific diets are a powerful causal driver of major systemic immunophenotypic variation. This effect occurred largely independently of the bulk composition of the bacterial microbiome (which was also driven by season and diet) and of host condition, demonstrating neither of these, per se, constrain immune allocation in healthy individuals. Nonetheless, through observations in multiple anatomical compartments, differentially exposed to the direct effects of food and immunity, we found evidence of immune-driven control of bacterial community composition in mucus layers. This points to the interactive nature of the host-microbiome relationship, and is the first time, to our knowledge, that this causal chain (diet. immunity. microbiome) has been demonstrated in wild vertebrates. Microbiome effects on immunity were not excluded and, importantly, we identified outgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (especially mycolic-acid producing corynebacteria) as a consequence of the more animal-protein-rich summertime diet. This may provide part of the ultimate explanation (and possibly a proximal cue) for the dramatic immune re-adjustments that we saw in response to diet change.","[Friberg, Ida M.; Taylor, Joe D.; Jackson, Joseph A.] Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Salford, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Jackson, JA (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Salford, Lancs, England.",j.a.jackson@Salford.ac.uk,"Taylor, Joe D/F-2196-2015; Friberg, Ida M/B-8231-2011","Taylor, Joe D/0000-0003-0095-0869; ",Leverhulme Trust [RPG-301],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),This work was funded by a research grant from the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-301) held by JJ at Aberystwyth University.,,55,13,13,0,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

The high prevalence of multi-resistant and more virulent strains of S. aureus necessitates the development of new prevention and treatment strategies for S. aureus infection. Major advances towards understanding the pathogenesis of S. aureus diseases have been made using conventional mouse models, i.e., by infecting naive laboratory mice with human-adapted S. aureus strains. However, the failure to transfer certain results obtained in these murine systems to humans highlights the limitations of such models. Indeed, numerous S. aureus vaccine candidates showed promising results in conventional mouse models but failed to offer protection in human clinical trials. These limitations arise not only from the widely discussed physiological differences between mice and humans, but also from the lack of attention that is paid to the specific interactions of S. aureus with its respective host. For instance, animal-derived S. aureus lineages show a high degree of host tropism and carry a repertoire of host-specific virulence and immune evasion factors. Mouse-adapted S. aureus strains, humanized mice, and microbiome-optimized mice are promising approaches to overcome these limitations and could improve transferability of animal experiments to human trials in the future.","[Mrochen, Daniel M.; Fernandes de Oliveira, Liliane M.; Raafat, Dina; Holtfreter, Silva] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Immunol & Transfus Med, Dept Immunol, Ferdinand Sauerbruch Str DZ 7, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany; [Raafat, Dina] Alexandria Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Alexandria 21521, Egypt",Greifswald Medical School; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University,"Mrochen, DM (corresponding author), Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Immunol & Transfus Med, Dept Immunol, Ferdinand Sauerbruch Str DZ 7, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany.",mrochend@uni-greifswald.de; liliane.fernandes@med.uni-greifswald.de; dina.raafat@med.uni-greifswald.de; silva.holtfreter@med.uni-greifswald.de,"Raafat, Dina/ABD-2266-2021","Mrochen, Daniel Michael/0000-0002-5893-1778; Raafat, Dina/0000-0002-3610-9863","BMBF, InfectControl 2020, project InVAC [FKZ 03ZZ0806B]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FKZ GRK1870/1]; European Social Fund, Card-ii-Omics [ESF/14-BMA55-0037/16]; DFG (German Research Foundation) [393148499]; Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Greifswald","BMBF, InfectControl 2020, project InVAC(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Social Fund, Card-ii-Omics; DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Greifswald","This research was funded by BMBF, InfectControl 2020, project InVAC, FKZ 03ZZ0806B to D.M.M.; by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant number FKZ GRK1870/1 to L.M.F.d.O., and by the European Social Fund, Card-ii-Omics, ESF/14-BMA55-0037/16 to S.H.

Although STING has important functions in the host defense against pathogens and in autoimmune diseases, its physiological relevance in intestinal homeostasis is largely unknown. In this study, we show that STING(-/-) mice presented defective protective mechanisms of intestinal mucosa, including decreased number of goblet cells, diminished mucus production, and lower levels of secretory IgA, when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Fecal content and microbiota DNA could activate STING, indicating a role of this molecule in gut. Microbiota composition was altered in STING(-/-) mice toward a more inflammatory profile, evidencing a reduction in the Allobacolum and Bifidobacterium groups along with increase in Disulfovibrio bacteria. Absence of STING lead to decrease in induced intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and to increase in group 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC1) as well as ILC3 frequencies and decrease in ILC2 in the colon. Development and function of Foxp3+ and LAP+ regulatory Tcells were also compromised in STING(-/-) mice. Moreover, these mice were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfateinduced colitis, T-cell-induced colitis, and enteric Salmonella typhimurium infection when compared with WT animals. Therefore, our results identify an important role of STING in maintaining gut homeostasis and also a protective effect in controlling gut inflammation.","[Canesso, M. C. C.; Lemos, L.; Neves, T.

Due to urbanization in the 20th century, they were gradually abandoned and became wild cattle straying in suburban Hong Kong. Recently, these cattle were observed to have become omnivorous by eating leftover barbeque food waste in country parks. Microbiome analysis was performed on fecal samples of the omnivorous cattle using deep sequencing and the resulting microbiome was compared with that of traditional herbivorous cattle in Southern China. A more diverse gut microbiome was observed in the omnivorous cattle, suggesting that microbiota diversity increases as diet variation increases. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Anaeroplasma, Anaerovorax, Bacillus, Coprobacillus and Solibacillus significantly increased and those of Anaerofustis, Butyricimonas, Campylobacter, Coprococcus, Dehalobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, rc4.4, RFN20, Succinivibrio and Turicibacter significantly decreased in the omnivorous group. The increase in microbial community levels of Bacillus and Anaerovorax likely attributes to the inclusion of meat in the diet; while the decrease in relative abundance of Coprococcus, Butyricimonas, Succinivibrio, Campylobacter and Phascolarctobacterium may reflect the reduction in grass intake. Furthermore, an increased consumption of resistant starch likely resulted in the increase in abundance of Anaeroplasma. In conclusion, a significant change in the gut microbial community was observed in the omnivorous cattle, suggesting that diet may be one of the factors that may signal an adaptation response by the cattle to maintain feed efficiency as a consequence of the change in environment.

Although much information has been gained through laboratory studies of acute starvation, little is known about how starvation affects an animal once food is again available (i.e. during the refeeding and recovery phases). Many animals exhibit a curious phenomenon - some seem to 'get better' at starving following exposure to one or more starvation events - by this we mean that they exhibit potentially adaptive responses, including reduced rates of mass loss, reduced metabolic rates, and lower costs of digestion. During subsequent refeedings they may also exhibit improved digestive efficiency and more rapid mass gain. Importantly, these responses can last until the next starvation bout or even be inherited and expressed in the subsequent generation. Currently, however, little is known about the molecular regulation and physiological mechanisms underlying these changes. Here, we identify areas of research that can fill in the most pressing knowledge gaps. In particular, we highlight how recently refined techniques (e.g. stable isotope tracers, quantitative magnetic resonance and thermal measurement) as well as next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g. RNA-seq, proteomics and holobiome sequencing) can address specific starvation-focused questions. We also describe outstanding unknowns ripe for future research regarding the timing and severity of starvation, and concerning the persistence of these responses and their interactions with other ecological stressors.","[McCue, Marshall D.] St Marys Univ, Dept Biol Sci, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA; [Terblanche, John S.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Benoit, Joshua B.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biol Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",Stellenbosch University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"McCue, MD (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Biol Sci, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA.",mmccue1@stmarytx.edu,"Terblanche, John/AAB-4457-2020; McCue, Marshall/A-6227-2011","Terblanche, John/0000-0001-9665-9405; McCue, Marshall/0000-0003-1255-285X",,,,,148,30,30,1,32,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

However, little is known about Culicoides imicola microbiota and its influence on this insect's biology. In this study, the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on C. imicola microbiota was characterized using shotgun-metagenomic sequencing of whole-body DNA samples. Wild-caught C. imicola adult nulliparous females were sampled in two locations from Sicily, Italy. The climatic variables of temperature and soil moisture from both localities were recorded together with potential host bloodmeal sources. Shared core microbiome among C. imicola populations included Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Halomonas, Candidatus Zinderia, Propionibacterium, and Schizosaccharomyces. Specific and unique taxa were also found in C. imicola from each location, highlighting similarities and differences in microbiome composition between the two populations. DNA and protein identification showed differences in host preferences between the two populations, with Homo sapiens and Canis lupus familiaris L. being the preferred bloodmeal source in both locations. A principal component analysis showed that the combined effect of host preferences (H. sapiens) and local soil moisture factors shape the microbiome composition of wild-caught populations of C. imicola. These results contribute to characterizing the role of the microbiome in insect adaptation and its utility in predicting geographic expansion of Culicoides species with potential implications for the control of vector-borne diseases.","[Diaz-Sanchez, S.; Hernandez-Jarguin, A.; de Mera, I.

The skin and fur of mammals can host a wide variety of ectoparasites, many of which are phylogenetically diverse, specialized, and specifically adapted to their hosts. Among hematophagous dipteran parasites, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to serve as important attractants, leading parasites to compatible sources of blood meals. VOCs have been hypothesized to be mediated by host-associated bacteria, which may thereby indirectly influence parasitism. Host-associated bacteria may also influence parasitism directly, as has been observed in interactions between animal gut microbiota and malarial parasites. Hypotheses relating bacterial symbionts and eukaryotic parasitism have rarely been tested among humans and domestic animals, and to our knowledge have not been tested in wild vertebrates. In this study, we used Afrotropical bats, hematophagous ectoparasitic bat flies, and haemosporidian (malarial) parasites vectored by bat flies as a model to test the hypothesis that the vertebrate host microbiome is linked to parasitism in a wild system. We identified significant correlations between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages, as well as striking differences in skin microbial network characteristics between ectoparasitized and nonectoparasitized bats. We also identified links between the oral microbiome and presence of malarial parasites among miniopterid bats. Our results support the hypothesis that microbial symbionts may serve as indirect mediators of parasitism among eukaryotic hosts and parasites.","[Lutz, Holly L.; Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92161 USA; [Lutz, Holly L.; Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lutz, Holly L.; Dick, Carl W.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Negaunee Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Dick, Carl W.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago); Western Kentucky University,"Lutz, HL (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92161 USA.",hllutz@health.ucsd.edu,"Dick, Carl/AAE-7154-2022","Gilbert, Jack/0000-0001-7920-7001; Lutz, Holly/0000-0001-6454-809X",National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology [1611948]; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1611948] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We thank the Kenya Wildlife Service and the Uganda Wildlife Authority for permission to conduct research in national parks, and Simon Musila of the National Museums of Kenya for his logistical support.

Pre-emptive deworming is often recommended for equid translocations but eliminating parasites prior to translocation could cause disruptions in a balanced host-parasite relationship, adding an additional stressor to an already stressful intervention involving capture, transport, and adaptation to a new environment. Following a disease risk assessment, we decided against pre-emptive deworming and focused on monitoring the first group of nine translocated kulan in a large acclimatization enclosure prior to release. Over the 5-month acclimatization period, we regularly collected fecal samples and analyzed the shedding intensity of gastro-intestinal parasite eggs, obtained time budgets through behavioral observations, and visually assessed body condition. We identified strongyles (Strongylinae and Cyathostominae) and pinworms (Oxyuris equi) in fecal samples. All individuals shed strongyle eggs and two of the nine individuals had higher shedding intensities, but rarely reached levels for which deworming is recommended. All kulan appeared healthy throughout the observation period, aggressive interactions were very rare, and time budgets were very similar and dominated by feeding. Our results suggest that in translocation projects where the risk of introducing new parasites is minimal, pre-emptive treatment in wild equids can be replaced with non-invasive monitoring during the acclimatization period. We acknowledge that the small number of kulan, the large size of the enclosure, and the low temperatures during the animals stay in the acclimatization enclosure may all have reduced infestation pressure.","[Gliga, Diana S.; Walzer, Chris; Kaczensky, Petra] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Dept Interdisciplinary Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Petrova, Natalia] Moscow State Acad Vet Med & Biotechnol, Moscow, Russia; [Linnell, John D.

For example, across latitudinal gradients, some organisms may trade off between traits that maximize fitness components in one, but not both, of somatic maintenance or reproductive output. Latitudinal gradients in life history strategies are traditionally attributed to environmental selection on an animal's genotype, without any consideration of the possible impact of associated microorganisms (microbiota) on life history traits. Here, we show in Drosophila melanogaster, a key model for studying local adaptation and life history strategy, that excluding the microbiota from definitions of local adaptation is a major shortfall. First, we reveal that an isogenic fly line reared with different bacteria varies the investment in early reproduction versus somatic maintenance. Next, we show that in wild fruit flies, the abundance of these same bacteria was correlated with the latitude and life history strategy of the flies, suggesting geographic specificity of the microbiota composition. Variation in microbiota composition of locally adapted D. melanogaster could be attributed to both the wild environment and host genetic selection. Finally, by eliminating or manipulating the microbiota of fly lines collected across a latitudinal gradient, we reveal that host genotype contributes to latitude-specific life history traits independent of the microbiota and that variation in the microbiota can suppress or reverse the differences between locally adapted fly lines. Together, these findings establish the microbiota composition of a model animal as an essential consideration in local adaptation.","[Walters, Amber W.; Hughes, Rachel C.; Call, Tanner B.; Walker, Carson J.; Wilcox, Hailey; Petersen, Samara C.; Chaston, John M.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Rudman, Seth M.; Schmidt, Paul S.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Newell, Peter D.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY USA",Brigham Young University; University of Pennsylvania; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) - Oswego; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Chaston, JM (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",john_chaston@byu.edu,,"Schmidt, Paul/0000-0002-8076-6705","NRSA postdoctoral fellowship [1F32GM099374-01]; NIH [R01GM095372, R01GM100366]; Brigham Young University",NRSA postdoctoral fellowship(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Brigham Young University,"NRSA postdoctoral fellowship, Grant/Award Number: 1F32GM099374-01; NIH, Grant/Award Number: R01GM095372 and R01GM100366; Brigham Young University",,130,32,32,5,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We currently lack a clear understanding of the adaptations in digestive physiology necessary for this species to subsist on a graminoid-based diet, but digestion in other graminivores, such as ruminants, relies heavily on the microbial community residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Furthermore, geladas form complex, multilevel societies, making them a suitable system for investigating links between sociality and the GI microbiota. Results: Here, we explore the gastrointestinal microbiota of gelada monkeys inhabiting an intact ecosystem and document how factors like multilevel social structure and seasonal changes in diet shape the GI microbiota. We compare the gelada GI microbiota to those of other primate species, reporting a gradient from geladas to herbivorous specialist monkeys to dietary generalist monkeys and lastly humans, the ultimate ecological generalists. We also compare the microbiotas of the gelada GI tract and the sheep rumen, finding that geladas are highly enriched for cellulolytic bacteria associated with ruminant digestion, relative to other primates. Conclusions: This study represents the first analysis of the gelada GI microbiota, providing insights into the adaptations underlying graminivory in a primate. Our results also highlight the role of social organization in structuring the GI microbiota within a society of wild animals.","[Trosvik, Pal; de Muinck, Eric J.; Rueness, Eli K.; Mekonnen, Addisu] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, Oslo, Norway; [Fashing, Peter J.; Nga Nguyen] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Anthropol, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Fashing, Peter J.; Nga Nguyen] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Environm Studies Program, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Beierschmitt, Evan C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Callingham, Kadie R.] Bwindi Gorilla Project, Bwindi Impenetrable Natl Pk, Kanungu, Uganda; [Kraus, Jacob B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Trew, Thomas H.] Cleve Lodge, Minster Rd, Ramsgate CT12 4BA, Kent, England; [Moges, Amera] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Biol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Addisu] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Venkataraman, Vivek V.] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Oslo; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Bahir Dar University; Addis Ababa University; Harvard University,"Trosvik, P (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, Oslo, Norway.",pal.trosvik@ibv.uio.no,"Mekonnen, Addisu/U-6087-2018","Mekonnen, Addisu/0000-0001-8403-1071; de Muinck, Eric/0000-0001-5606-3172",Research Council of Norway [230796/F20]; Rufford Small Grants [11727-1]; People's Trust for Endangered Species; San Diego Zoo; California State University Fullerton; Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation; Primate Conservation Inc.; Gibson,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Rufford Small Grants; People's Trust for Endangered Species; San Diego Zoo; California State University Fullerton; Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation; Primate Conservation Inc.; Gibson,"This study was funded by Research Council of Norway grant 230796/F20, Rufford Small Grants 11727-1, and the People's Trust for Endangered Species.

In species in which social status determines access to resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16S, 44 for eukaryote 18S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals. We propose that free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes.","[Heitlinger, Emanuel] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Res Grp Ecol & Evolut Mol Parasite Host Interact, Berlin, Germany; [Heitlinger, Emanuel] Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, Mol Parasitol, Berlin, Germany; [Ferreira, Susana C.

One of the greatest concerns regarding the conservation of this species is the extensive use of pesticides in areas surrounding their natural habitat. In recent years, the adaptation and persistence of animal species in human-impacted environments have been associated with microbiota. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize the oral bacterial community of wild M. admirabilis and to address the question of how this community might contribute to this toad's adaptation in the anthropogenic environment as well as its general metabolic capabilities. A total of 11 oral samples collected from wild M. admirabilis were characterized and analyzed via high-throughput sequencing. Fragments of the 16S rRNA variable region 4 (V4) were amplified, and sequencing was conducted using an Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) System with 316 chips. A total of 181,350 sequences were obtained, resulting in 16 phyla, 34 classes, 39 orders, and 77 families. Proteobacteria dominated (53%) the oral microbiota of toads, followed by Firmicutes (18%), Bacteroidetes (17%), and Actinobacteria (5%). No significant differences in microbial community profile from among the samples were reported, which suggests that the low dietary diversity observed in this population may directly influence the bacterial composition. Inferences of microbiome function were performed using PICRUSt2 software. Important pathways (e.g., xenobiotic degradation pathways for pesticides and aromatic phenolic compounds) were detected, which suggests that the bacterial communities may serve important roles in M. admirabilis health and survival in the anthropogenic environment. Overall, our results have important implications for the conservation and management of this microendemic and critically endangered species.","[Mann, Michele Bertoni; Frazzon, Ana Paula Guedes] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Postgrad Program Agr & Environm Microbiol, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, BR-90050170 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Prichula, Janira; de Castro, Icaro Maia Santos; Severo, Juliana Mello] Fed Univ Hlth Sci Porto Alegre, Dept Hlth Sci, BR-90050170 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Abadie, Michelle] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Biosci Inst, BR-91509900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [De Freitas Lima, Thayna Mendes; Caorsi, Valentina; Borges-Martins, Marcio] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Postgrad Program Anim Biol, Dept Zool, Biosci Inst, BR-91509900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Caorsi, Valentina] Fdn Edmund Mach, Inst Agr San Michele Adige, Res & Innovat Ctr, I-38010 San Michele All Adige 1, Italy; [Frazzon, Jeverson] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Biochem & Mol Biol Microorganisms Lab, BR-91509900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Fondazione Edmund Mach; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Frazzon, APG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Postgrad Program Agr & Environm Microbiol, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, BR-90050170 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",mbertonimann@gmail.com; janira.pri@gmail.com; icaromscastro@gmail.com; juliana.bioinformatica@gmail.com; abadie.mi@gmail.com; thaynamfl@gmail.com; valenzc@gmail.com; borges.martins@ufrgs.br; jeverson.frazzon@ufrgs.br; ana.frazzon@ufrgs.br,"Castro, caro/AAK-4962-2020; Frazzon, Jeverson/L-6402-2013; Frazzon, Ana Paula Guedes/ABI-2523-2020; Borges-Martins, Marcio/I-3274-2012; Zaffaroni-Caorsi, Valentina/AAD-1093-2019","Castro, caro/0000-0002-3484-8718; Frazzon, Ana Paula Guedes/0000-0002-1029-5776; Borges-Martins, Marcio/0000-0001-9328-5794; Zaffaroni-Caorsi, Valentina/0000-0003-4166-9600; Bertoni Mann, Michele/0000-0003-3335-8837; Frazzon, Jeverson/0000-0002-0209-1466","Brazilian Microbiome Project (BMP); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico do Brasil (CNPq) [302574/2017-0, 407886/2018-4, 305495/2018-6]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) of the Brazilian government",Brazilian Microbiome Project (BMP); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico do Brasil (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) of the Brazilian government(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"We are grateful to the Brazilian Microbiome Project (BMP) that supported this work.

How this balance is achieved is not fully understood, and disruption of this relationship can lead to disease. Excessive inflammatory responses to resident microbes are characteristic of certain gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The immune dysregulation of IBD has complex genetic underpinnings that cannot be fully recapitulated with single-gene-knockout models. A deeper understanding of the genetic regulation of innate immune responses to resident microbes requires the ability to measure immune responses in the presence and absence of the microbiota using vertebrate models with complex genetic variation. Here, we describe a new gnotobiotic vertebrate model to explore the natural genetic variation that contributes to differences in innate immune responses to microbiota. Threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, has been used to study the developmental genetics of complex traits during the repeated evolution from ancestral oceanic to derived freshwater forms. We established methods to rear germ-free stickleback larvae and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with single bacterial isolates. We characterized the innate immune response of these fish to resident gut microbes by quantifying the neutrophil cells in conventionally reared monoassociated or germ-free stickleback from both oceanic and freshwater populations grown in a common intermediate salinity environment. We found that oceanic and freshwater fish in the wild and in the laboratory share many intestinal microbial community members. However, oceanic fish mount a strong immune response to residential microbiota, whereas freshwater fish frequently do not. A strong innate immune response was uniformly observed across oceanic families, but this response varied among families of freshwater fish. The gnotobiotic stickleback model that we have developed therefore provides a platform for future studies mapping the natural genetic basis of the variation in immune response to microbes.","[Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn; Small, Clayton M.; Currey, Mark; Cresko, William A.] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn; Mittge, Erika K.; Agarwal, Meghna; Guillemin, Karen] Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA",University of Oregon; University of Oregon; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Milligan-Myhre, K (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;Milligan-Myhre, K (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;Milligan-Myhre, K (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",kmillig1@uaa.alaska.edu,"Guillemin, Karen/HZL-0035-2023; Cresko, William/H-4010-2014","Cresko, William/0000-0002-3496-8074; Guillemin, Karen/0000-0001-6004-9955","National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health [P50GM098911, F32DK096753, R24RR032670]",National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)),"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers P50GM098911 (to K.G. and W.A.C.), F32DK096753 (to K.M.-M.) and R24RR032670 (to W.A.C.).

Here, we generated 5,596 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the gut metagenomes of 180 predominantly wild animal species representing 5 classes, in addition to 14 existing animal gut metagenome data sets. The MAGs comprised 1,522 species-level genome bins (SGBs), most of which were novel at the species, genus, or family level, and the majority were enriched in host versus environment metagenomes. Many traits distinguished SGBs enriched in host or environmental biomes, including the number of antimicrobial resistance genes. We identified 1,986 diverse biosynthetic gene clusters; only 23 clustered with any MIBiG database references. Gene-based assembly revealed tremendous gene diversity, much of it host or environment specific. Our MAG and gene data sets greatly expand the microbial genome repertoire and provide a broad view of microbial adaptations to the vertebrate gut. IMPORTANCE Microbiome studies on a select few mammalian species (e.g., humans, mice, and cattle) have revealed a great deal of novel genomic diversity in the gut microbiome. However, little is known of the microbial diversity in the gut of other vertebrates. We studied the gut microbiomes of a large set of mostly wild animal species consisting of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Unfortunately, we found that existing reference databases commonly used for metagenomic analyses failed to capture the microbiome diversity among vertebrates. To increase database representation, we applied advanced metagenome assembly methods to our animal gut data and to many public gut metagenome data sets that had not been used to obtain microbial genomes. Our resulting genome and gene cluster collections comprised a great deal of novel taxonomic and genomic diversity, which we extensively characterized. Our findings substantially expand what is known of microbial genomic diversity in the vertebrate gut.","[Youngblut, Nicholas D.; De la Cuesta-Zuluaga, Jacobo; Dauser, Silke; Ley, Ruth E.] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Microbiome Sci, Tubingen, Germany; [Reischer, Georg H.; Schuster, Nathalie; Farnleitner, Andreas H.] TU Wien, Res Grp Environm Microbiol & Mol Diagnost, Inst Chem Environm & Biosci Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Reischer, Georg H.; Farnleitner, Andreas H.] ICC Interuniv Cooperat Ctr Water & Hlth, Vienna, Austria; [Walzer, Chris; Stalder, Gabrielle] Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Walzer, Chris] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY USA; [Farnleitner, Andreas H.] Karl Landsteiner Univ Hlth Sci, Res Div Water Qual & Hlth, Krems An Der Donau, Austria",Max Planck Society; Technische Universitat Wien; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Wildlife Conservation Society,"Youngblut, ND (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Microbiome Sci, Tubingen, Germany.",nyoungblut@tuebingen.mpg.de,"Reischer, Georg Hubert/N-6381-2017; Ley, Ruth E/M-8542-2014","Reischer, Georg Hubert/0000-0002-3962-8685; Ley, Ruth E/0000-0002-9087-1672; de la Cuesta-Zuluaga, Juan Jacobo/0000-0002-7369-992X; Walzer, Chris/0000-0002-0437-5147; Youngblut, Nicholas/0000-0002-7424-5276; Farnleitner, Andreas/0000-0002-0542-5425","Department of Microbiome Science at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P23900, P22032]; Science Call 2015 Resource und Lebensgrundlage Wasser Project - Niederosterreichische Forschungs- und Bildungsgesellschaft (NFB) [SC15-016]",Department of Microbiome Science at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Science Call 2015 Resource und Lebensgrundlage Wasser Project - Niederosterreichische Forschungs- und Bildungsgesellschaft (NFB),This work was supported by the Department of Microbiome Science at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology.

Here, we characterized microbiota of four Liriomyza leaf miner fly species totaling 310 individuals across 43 geographical populations in China and assessed whether the microbiota of the wild leaf miner was acquired from the soil microbiota or the host plant microbiota, using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. Bacterial communities differed significantly among four leaf miner species but did not mirror host phylogeny. Microbiota diversity in the native L. chinensis was significantly higher than in three invasive leaf miners (i.e., L. trifolii, L. huidobrensis, and L. sativae), yet the microbial community of the invasive species exhibited a more connected and complex network structure. Structural equation models revealed that host species identity was more important than environmental factors (e.g., geography, climate, or plants) in shaping microbiota composition. Using neutral and null model analyses, we found that deterministic processes like variable selection played a primary role in driving microbial community assembly, with some influence by stochastic processes like drift. The relative degree of these processes governing microbiota was likely correlated with host species but independent of either geographical or climatic factors. Finally, source tracking analysis showed that leaf miners might acquire microbes from their host plant rather than the soil. Our results provide a robust assessment of the ecological processes governing bacterial community assembly and potential sources of microbes in invasive leaf miners. IMPORTANCE The invasion of foreign species, including leaf miners, is a major threat to world biota. Host-associated microbiota may facilitate host adaption and expansion in a variety of ways. Thus, understanding the processes that drive leaf miner microbiota assembly is imperative for better management of invasive species. However, how microbial communities assemble during the leaf miner invasions and how predictable the processes remain unexplored. This work quantitatively deciphers the relative importance of deterministic process and stochastic process in governing the assembly of four leaf miner microbiotas and identifies potential sources of leaf miner-colonizing microbes from the soil-plant-leaf miner continuum. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the drive of leaf miner microbiota assembly.","[Zhu, Yu-Xi; Chang, Ya-Wen; Yang, Run; Wang, Yu-Cheng; Wang, Xin-Yu; Lu, Ming-Xing; Du, Yu-Zhou] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Hort & Plant Protect, Inst Appl Entomol, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wen, Tao] Nanjing Agr Univ, Educ Minist,Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Wast, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Solid Organ Wastes, Key Lab Plant Immun,Engn Ctr Resource Saving Fer, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Yangzhou University; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Du, YZ (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Sch Hort & Plant Protect, Inst Appl Entomol, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yzdu@yzu.edu.cn,"Wang, Yu/GZL-9655-2022; Zhu, Yu-Xi/CAH-8802-2022; Du, Yu/IAQ-9365-2023","Du, Yu-Zhou/0000-0002-4452-7125",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31901888]; Jiangsu Science & Technology Support Program [BE2014410],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Science & Technology Support Program,"We are very grateful to Kerry M.

Elevated habitat is a pivotal factor for wild sable survival and reproduction, and the adaptability is in part enabled through their gut microbial communities. Our observations show that despite having been forced to migrate from low altitudes to high altitudes because of anthropogenic habitat encroachment, wild sables showed robustness in adapting to harsh conditions. Additionally, we propose that the crucial factor enabling wild sables to survive in changeable environments was their gut microbial communities. It is widely understood that harsh conditions, such as high altitude and low temperature environments, have an adverse effect on wild fauna survival. However, our results suggested that increasing altitude can enhance some functions in wild sable gut microbial communities. In recent decades, wild sable (Carnivora Mustelidae Martes zibellina) habitats, which are often natural forests, have been squeezed by anthropogenic disturbances such as clear-cutting, tilling and grazing. Sables tend to live in sloped areas with relatively harsh conditions. Here, we determine effects of environmental factors on wild sable gut microbial communities between high and low altitude habitats using Illumina Miseq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Our results showed that despite wild sable gut microbial community diversity being resilient to many environmental factors, community composition was sensitive to altitude. Wild sable gut microbial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (relative abundance 38.23%), followed by Actinobacteria (30.29%), and Proteobacteria (28.15%). Altitude was negatively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes, suggesting sable likely consume more vegetarian food in lower habitats where plant diversity, temperature and vegetation coverage were greater. In addition, our functional genes prediction and qPCR results demonstrated that energy/fat processing microorganisms and functional genes are enriched with increasing altitude, which likely enhanced metabolic functions and supported wild sables to survive in elevated habitats. Overall, our results improve the knowledge of the ecological impact of habitat change, providing insights into wild animal protection at the mountain area with hash climate conditions.","[Su, Lantian; Tan, Haoxin; Khalid, Muhammed] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Agr & Biol, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinxin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Instrumental Anal Ctr, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Jin, Guangyao] Heilongjiang Acad Forestry, Inst Wild Anim, Haping Rd 134, Harbin 150081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yue] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Hexing Rd 26, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Romantschuk, Martin; Hui, Nan] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15140, Finland; [Yin, Shan] Minist Educ, Minist Sci & Technol, Shanghai Yangtze River Delta Ecoenvironm Change &, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Yin, Shan] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Shanghai Urban Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Northeast Forestry University - China; University of Helsinki,"Hui, N (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15140, Finland.",lanter_shawn666@sjtu.edu.cn; xinxin.liu@sjtu.edu.cn; changzhao@sjtu.edu.cn; mayue@nefu.edu.cn; hostage@sjtu.edu.cn; kokub32@gmail.com; Martin.romantschuk@helsinki.fi; yinshan@sjtu.edu.cn; nan.hui@sjtu.edu.cn,"Khalid, Muhammad/AAU-4383-2021; Haoxin, Tan/GRS-6658-2022; Hui, Nan/H-3560-2018","Romantschuk, Martin/0000-0003-0473-3327; Yin, Shan/0000-0003-0293-4176; Su, Lantian/0000-0002-1925-6706; Hui, Nan/0000-0001-8517-8454",Natural Science Foundation of China [42007048]; Shanghai Pujiang Project [2020-000224],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Project(Shanghai Pujiang Program),This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (project number: 42007048) and Shanghai Pujiang Project (Application number: 2020-000224).,,70,4,4,7,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAR,2021,11,3,,,,,,,865,10.3390/ani11030865,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11030865,,,18,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,RD0PM,33803658,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000633191500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A lingering controversy is whether the dingo has been tamed and has now reverted to its ancestral wild state or whether its ancestors were domesticated and it now resides on the continent as a feral dog. The goal of this article is to place the discussion onto a theoretical framework, highlight what is currently known about dingo origins and taxonomy and then make a series of experimentally testable organismal, cellular and biochemical predictions that we propose can focus future research. Discussion We consider a canid that has been unconsciously selected as a tamed animal and the endpoint of methodical or what we now call artificial selection as a domesticated animal. We consider wild animals that were formerly tamed as untamed and those wild animals that were formerly domesticated as feralized. Untamed canids are predicted to be marked by a signature of unconscious selection whereas feral animals are hypothesized to be marked by signatures of both unconscious and artificial selection. First, we review the movement of dingo ancestors into Australia. We then discuss how differences between taming and domestication may influence the organismal traits of skull morphometrics, brain and size, seasonal breeding, and sociability. Finally, we consider cellular and molecular level traits including hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic position of dingoes, metabolic genes that appear to be under positive selection and the potential for micronutrient compensation by the gut microbiome. Conclusions Western Australian Government policy is currently being revised to allow the widespread killing of the Australian dingo. These policies are based on an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary history of the canid and assume the dingo is feralized. However, accumulated evidence does not definitively show that the dingo was ever domesticated and additional focused research is required. We suggest that incorporating ancient DNA data into the debate concerning dingo origins will be pivotal to understanding the evolutionary history of the canid. Further, we advocate that future morphological, behavioural and genetic studies should focus on including genetically pure Alpine and Desert dingoes and not dingo-dog hybrids. Finally, we propose that future studies critically examine genes under selection in the dingo and employ the genome from a wild canid for comparison.","[Ballard, J.

Long-term use of antibiotics in birds leads to the development of many drug-resistant microorganisms, has a negative impact on the environment and the antibiotic residues in poultry meat pose hazards to consumers' health. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics used in poultry are good alternatives for antibiotic and antibiotic growth stimulants. However, such additives must be adapted to the species, age and intended use of birds. Our newly developed synbiotic formulas which comprised three, four or five strains ofLactobacillussp., as well asS. cerevisiaeand inulin, were administered in feed for meat-type chickens throughout the 42-day experimental period. The results showed that our new synbiotics do not have any unfavorable influence on chicken health and may modulate the immune response and biochemical parameters. The results are very promising, and our synbiotics can be considered as products for commercial use in poultry. However, these findings should be confirmed in future field experiments. In this study, the influence of new multi-strain synbiotics on chicken growth performance, hematology, serum biochemistry and immunity was explored. Each synbiotic preparation (A, B and C) comprised three, four or five strains ofLactobacillussp., respectively, as well asS. cerevisiaeand inulin. All strains used in the synbiotics originated from wild-type strains from animal farms in Poland. Six groups of chickens, ROSS 308 line, were fed with three different synbiotics at a dose of 0.5 g/1 kg of feed. Body weight, as well as the biochemical and hematological parameters of the animals in each study group, were determined on the 7th, 14th, 28th and 42nd day of life. Body weight on day 42 differed between groups and was the highest in control group. This group also had the highestfeed conversion ratio (FCR) value. All measured biochemical parameters were in the normal ranges for poultry; however, we observed a lower alkaline phosphatase (AP) concentration on day 7 in the groups fed with synbiotics, which correlated with a lower level of triglycerides in those groups. The aspartate transaminase (AST) concentration was significantly lower in all groups on day 42 in comparison with the control. On day 7, the control group showed the highest concentration of Ca, K and P. Other parameters did not differ significantly throughout the experiment. All groups showed a similar tendency of increase in the red blood cells (RBC) count according to the age of the birds. Every white blood cells (WBC) population showed differences in the proportions between T and B lymphocytes. The T cell and monocyte counts increased until day 28 in all groups. The results showed that our newly developed synbiotic formulas do not have any unfavorable influence on chicken health and may modulate immune response and biochemical parameters. However, this hypothesis needs to be evaluated in future experiments.","[Zbikowski, Artur; Pawlowski, Karol; Dolka, Beata; Nerc, Joanna; Szeleszczuk, Piotr] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Vet Med, Dept Pathol & Vet Diagnost, Nowoursynowska 159c St, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Slizewska, Katarzyna] Lodz Univ Technol, Inst Fermentat Technol & Microbiol, Dept Biotechnol & Food Sci, Wolczanska 171-173, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Lodz University of Technology,"Zbikowski, A (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Vet Med, Dept Pathol & Vet Diagnost, Nowoursynowska 159c St, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",artur_zbikowski@sggw.edu.pl; karol_pawlowski@sggw.edu.pl; katarzyna.slizewska@p.lodz.pl; beata_dolka@sggw.edu.pl; joanna_nerc@sggw.edu.pl; piotr_szeleszczuk@sggw.edu.pl,"_li_ewska, Katarzyna/M-8362-2018","_li_ewska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-3161-1707; Pawlowski, Karol/0000-0003-4565-2873; Zbikowski, Artur/0000-0001-5219-2065; Turniak, Joanna/0000-0001-7012-1826; /0000-0001-8836-5351",Program of Applied Research - National Centre for Research and Development [PBS3/A8/32/2015],Program of Applied Research - National Centre for Research and Development,"This research was supported by a grant from the Program of Applied Research funded by the National Centre for Research and Development no.

In such areas, captive breeding and release into the wild may be part of the solution to repopulation. Captivity, nonetheless, has been shown to greatly influence the species' microbiota relative to wild animals. Therefore, evaluation of the microbiota in both captive and wild squirrels could elucidate if special living conditions are needed in order to augment the survival rate of specimens reintroduced into the wild. Furthermore, the microflora profile of healthy red squirrels raised in captivity would support clinicians in addressing infectious disease episodes and also raise awareness of the zoonotic risk. Hence, this study documented the bacterial species carried by S. vulgaris, disclosing overall similarities and variability patterns of the microbiota identified in individuals from two different living environments. We predicted less diversity in the captive animals' microbiota, due to the restrictive diet and unchanging living conditions, but a higher prevalence of zoonotic bacteria, due to the proximity of humans and of other domestic species. In this respect, samples (n = 100) were taken from five body regions of 20 red squirrels, both free-ranging and bred in captivity, processed by classical microbiology techniques and further identified by biochemical assay (VITEK(R)2 Compact System). A relatively poor bacterial community, comprising 62 bacterial strains belonging to 18 species and 8 different genera, was identified. Most of these microorganisms were reported for the first time in S. vulgaris. The results suggest that the resident aerobic microbiota of S. vulgaris does not differ significantly depending on living environments, neither in diversity, nor in quantity of the cultivable isolates. Sciurus vulgaris (the Eurasian red squirrel) is native to Europe and Asia, but due to habitat destruction or fragmentation, interspecific competition, and infectious diseases, especially in European island areas the species finds itself at the brink of extinction. The repopulation of such bare habitats requires healthy squirrel specimens, either translocated from other wild habitats or reintroduced to the wilderness following captive breeding. Captivity, nonetheless, has shown an immense capacity to reshape the structure of wild species' microbiota, adapting it to the less diverse diet and fewer environmental challenges. Therefore, assessing the differences between wild and captive microbiota in this species could elucidate if special living conditions are needed in order to augment the survival rate of specimens reintroduced into the wild. Furthermore, the microflora profile of the normal flora of healthy red squirrels raised in captivity could support clinicians in addressing infectious diseases episodes and also raise awareness on the zoonotic risk. Hence, this study aimed at documenting the bacterial species carried by S. vulgaris, disclosing overall similarities and variability patterns of the microbiota identified in individuals from two different living environments. We anticipated that the bacterial community would be less diverse in individuals raised in captivity, owing to their restrictive diet and to unchanging conditions in the enclosure. We also hypothesized that there would be a higher prevalence of zoonotic microorganisms in the captive animals, due to the proximity of humans and of other domestic species. To test this, samples (n = 100) were taken from five body regions of 20 red squirrels, both free-ranging and bred in captivity, processed by classical microbiology techniques, and further identified by biochemical assay (VITEK(R)2 Compact System). A relatively poor bacterial community, comprising 62 bacterial strains belonging to 18 species and 8 different genera, was identified. Most of these microorganisms were reported for the first time in S. vulgaris. With no discrimination between living environments, the highest prevalence (p < 0.001), was registered in Staphylococcus sciuri (60%; 12/20), followed by Escherichia coli (45%; 9/20) and Bacillus cereus (35%; 7/20). The results suggest unremarkable differences in diversity and richness of the resident aerobic microbiota of S. vulgaris, in relation to the living environment.","[Olah, Diana Ioana; Pall, Emoke; Cerbu, Constantin; Zablau, Sergiu Dan; Suatean, Monica Ioana; Potarniche, Adrian Valentin; Vasiu, Aurel; Spinu, Marina] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Fac Vet Med, 3-5 Manastur St, Cluj Napoca 400372, Romania; [Duca, Gheorghita] Acad Agr & Forestry Sci Gheorghe Ionescu Sisesti, Inst Res & Dev Agro Montanol, Cristian 557085, Sibiu, Romania",University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca,"Olah, DI; Pall, E (corresponding author), Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Fac Vet Med, 3-5 Manastur St, Cluj Napoca 400372, Romania.",diana.olah@usamvcluj.ro; emoke.pall@usamvcluj.ro; constantin.cerbu@usamvcluj.ro; sergiu.zablau@gmail.ro; ghitaduca@yahoo.com; suateanmonica@gmail.com; adrian.potarniche@usamvcluj.ro; aurel_vasiu@yahoo.com; marina.spinu@gmail.com,"Pall, Emoke/AAF-5181-2020; Cerbu, Constantin/T-9830-2019; Adrian-Valentin, Potrniche/E-4255-2017","Pall, Emoke/0000-0002-7919-7381; Cerbu, Constantin/0000-0002-4603-0956; Adrian-Valentin, Potrniche/0000-0002-7749-8543",,,,,103,0,0,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAR,2022,12,5,,,,,,,666,10.3390/ani12050666,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12050666,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,ZT2MF,35268234,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-06-01,WOS:000768986900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Once introduced into captivity, however, the gut microbial composition of free-living individuals can change dramatically. At present, little is known about gut microbial changes associated with adaptation to a synanthropic lifestyle in commensal species, compared with their non-commensal counterparts. Here, we compare the taxonomic composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities across three gut sections in synanthropic house mouse (Mus musculus) and a closely related non-synanthropic mound-building mouse (Mus spicilegus).ResultsUsing Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons, we found higher bacterial diversity in M. spicilegus and detected 11 bacterial operational taxonomic units with significantly different proportions. Notably, abundance of Oscillospira, which is typically higher in lean or outdoor pasturing animals, was more abundant in non-commensal M. spicilegus. ITS2-based barcoding revealed low diversity and high uniformity of gut fungi in both species, with the genus Kazachstania clearly dominant.ConclusionsThough differences in gut bacteria observed in the two species can be associated with their close association with humans, changes due to a move from commensalism to captivity would appear to have caused larger shifts in microbiota.","[Bendova, Barbora; Schmiedova, Lucie; Kreisinger, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bendova, Barbora; Pialek, Jaroslav; Dureje, Ludovit; Schmiedova, Lucie; Cizkova, Dagmar] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Studenec Res Facil, Brno, Czech Republic; [Martin, Jean-Francois] Univ Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, CBGP Montpellier,SupAgro,INRA, Montferrier Sur Lez, France",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Kreisinger, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",jakubkreisinger@seznam.cz,"Kreisinger, Jakub/H-4020-2011; Schmiedov, Lucie/S-3351-2017","Schmiedov, Lucie/0000-0003-2180-5281; Cizkova, Dagmar/0000-0001-5031-7792; Pialek, Jaroslav/0000-0002-0829-7481; Kreisinger, Jakub/0000-0001-9375-9814; Bendova, Barbora/0000-0003-1701-9878",Czech Science Foundation [18-17796Y]; Grant Agency of Charles University [1501218]; SVV Project [260571/2020],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Grant Agency of Charles University; SVV Project,"This study was supported through the Czech Science Foundation, Project no. 18-17796Y, and the Grant Agency of Charles University, Project no. 1501218.

Rates of nonsusceptibility (including resistant and intermediate categories) to other 16 antimicrobials tested varied from 69.3% to 0.4%, A considerable proportion (48.0%) of the strains was multidrug-resistant and diverse genetic determinants associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified. Tetracycline-resistant strains carried the tet(M) and/or tet(L) genes. Macrolides resistance was associated with the erm(B), erm(A) and mefA genes, while 43.2% of the isolates were negative for the investigated genes. High-level resistance to gentamicin associated with the aac(6')-le-aph(2 '')-la gene was detected in one E. faecalis strain. The two strains presenting high-level resistance to streptomycin were negative for the ant(6')-Ia, ant(3')-Ia, ant(9')-Ia and ant(9')-Ib genes. The vat(D) gene was found in all the 47 quinupristin/dalfopristin resistant strains identified as non-E. faecalis. Analysis of PFGE profiles of E. hirae strains after restriction with SmaI demonstrated the occurrence of five clonal groups. The predominant E. hirae clone was distributed among birds in the two institutions, suggesting that this clone was well adapted to the host and environments investigated. The four clonal groups identified among E. faecalis were composed by small numbers of strains and, generally, restricted to birds in the same sector. The occurrence of enterococcal strains exhibiting antimicrobial resistance traits and carrying genetic determinants that represent potential threats to the health of both humans and animals, in the intestinal microbiota of A. aestiva, highlights the need for additional monitoring studies to elucidate the population structure and the dynamics of transmission of these microorganisms among animals, humans and the environment.
